Preface: Steering the country through compacts and 
consensus
The economy continues to expand
In April, we commenced a new financial year. In May, we learnt that the Indian economy is 
estimated to have grown 8.2% in real terms in FY24. In June, a new government took office. The 
National Democratic Alliance government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has returned 
to power with a historic mandate for a third term. His unprecedented third popular mandate 
signals political and policy continuity.
The Indian economy is on a strong wicket and stable footing, demonstrating resilience 
in the face of geopolitical challenges. The Indian economy has consolidated its post-Covid 
recovery with policymakers – fiscal and monetary – ensuring economic and financial stability. 
Nonetheless, change is the only constant for a country with high growth aspirations. For 
the recovery to be sustained, there has to be heavy lifting on the domestic front because the 
environment has become extraordinarily difficult to reach agreements on key global issues such 
as trade, investment and climate.
High economic growth in FY24 came on the heels of growth rates of 9.7% and 7.0%, 
respectively, in the previous two financial years. The headline inflation rate is largely under 
control, although the inflation rate of some specific food items is elevated. The trade deficit 
was lower in FY24 than in FY23, and the current account deficit for the year is around 0.7% of 
GDP. In fact, the current account registered a surplus in the last quarter of the financial year. 
Foreign exchange reserves are ample. Public investment has sustained capital formation in the 
last several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing 
in FY22. Now, it has to receive the baton from the public sector and sustain the investment 
momentum in the economy. The signs are encouraging.
National income data show that non-financial private-sector capital formation, measured 
in current prices, expanded vigorously in FY22 and FY23 after a decline in FY21. However, 
investment in machinery and equipment declined for two consecutive years, FY20 and FY21, 
before rebounding strongly. Early corporate sector data for FY24 suggest that capital formation 
in the private sector continued to expand but at a slower rate.
Sustaining overseas investor interest will require effort
Foreign Direct Investment, the subject of much analysis, has held up. RBI data on India’s 
Balance of Payments shows us that the investment interest of external investors, measured in 
terms of dollar inflows of new capital, was USD45.8 billion in FY24 compared to USD47.6 billion 
in FY23. This slight decline is in line with global trends. Reinvestment of earnings remained the 
same. Repatriation of investment was USD29.3 billion in FY23 and USD44.5 billion in FY24. 
Many private equity investors took advantage of buoyant equity markets in India and exited 
profitably. It is a sign of a healthy market environment that offers profitable exits to investors, 
which will bring newer investments in the years to come. That said, the environment for foreign 
direct investment to grow in the coming years is not highly favourable for many reasons.
Interest rates in developed countries are much higher than they were during and before 
Covid years. This not only means a higher cost of funding but also a higher opportunity cost to 
invest abroad. Second, emerging economies have to compete with active industrial policies in 
developed economies involving considerable subsidies that encourage domestic investment. 

viii
Third, notwithstanding the impressive strides made in the last decade, uncertainties and 
interpretations related to transfer pricing, taxes, import duties and non-tax policies remain to 
be addressed. Lastly, geopolitical uncertainties, which are on the rise, will likely exert a bigger 
influence on capital flows, notwithstanding other reasons for preferring to invest in India.
Shocks and not structural forces have influenced employment
On employment generation, the Periodic Labour Force Survey provides quarterly data 
on urban employment indicators and annually for the entire country, including rural India. 
A surge in agriculture employment is partly explained by reverse migration and the entry 
of women into the labour force in rural India. The Annual Survey of Industries has data on 
workers in nearly 2.0 lakh Indian factories. The total number of factory jobs grew annually by 
3.6% between 2013-14 and 2021-22. Somewhat more satisfyingly, they grew faster at 4.0% in 
factories employing more than a hundred workers than in smaller factories (those with less 
than a hundred workers). The annual growth rate was 1.2% in the latter set of factories. In 
absolute numbers, employment in Indian factories has grown from 1.04 crore to 1.36 crore 
in this period. India does not yet have a corresponding Annual Survey of Services. The lack of 
availability of timely data on the absolute number of (formal and informal) jobs created even 
at annual intervals, let alone at higher frequencies, in various sectors – agriculture, industry 
including manufacturing and services – precludes an objective analysis of the labour market 
situation in the country.
The Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises for 2022-23, when compared with 
the results of the NSS 73rd round of the ‘Key Indicators of Unincorporated Non-Agricultural 
Enterprises (Excluding Construction) in India’ shows that overall employment in these 
enterprises fell from 11.1 crore in 2015-16 to 10.96 crores. There was a reduction of 54 lakh 
workers in manufacturing but the expansion of the workforce in trade and services gained in jobs 
limited the overall reduction in the number of workers in unincorporated enterprises to around 
16.45 lakhs between these two periods. This comparison masks a big jump in manufacturing 
jobs that seems to have occurred between 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) and 2022-23 
(October 2022 to September 2023).
India suffered two big economic shocks in quick succession. Bad debts in the banking system 
and high corporate indebtedness were one. It took the first term of the present government 
and more to bring it under control. The Covid pandemic was the second shock and quickly 
followed the first one. So, it is difficult to conclude that the Indian economy’s ability to create 
employment is structurally impaired. Nonetheless, going forward, the task is cut out. 
Between the last Economic survey published in January 2023 and this one, big changes are 
afoot in the geopolitical environment. The global backdrop for India’s march towards Viksit 
Bharat in 2047 could not be more different from what it was during the rise of China between 
1980 and 2015. Then, globalisation was at the cusp of its long expansion. Geopolitics was largely 
calm with the end of the Cold War, and Western powers welcomed and even encouraged the 
rise of China and its integration into the world economy. Concerns over climate change and 
global warming were not so pervasive or grave then as they are now. Fourth, the advent of 
Artificial Intelligence casts a huge pall of uncertainty as to its impact on workers across all skill 
levels – low, semi and high. These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth 
rates for India in the coming years and decades. Overcoming these requires a grand alliance of 
union and state governments and the private sector. 

ix
Employment generation is the real bottom line for the private sector 
It is worth reiterating that job creation happens mainly in the private sector. Second, many 
(not all) of the issues that influence economic growth, job creation and productivity and the 
actions to be taken therein are in the domain of state governments. So, in other words, India 
needs a tripartite compact, more than ever before, to deliver on the higher and rising aspirations 
of Indians and complete the journey to Viksit Bharat by 2047.
In more than one respect, the action lies with the private sector. In terms of financial 
performance, the corporate sector has never had it so good. Results of a sample of over 33,000 
companies show that, in the three years between FY20 and FY23, the profit before taxes of 
the Indian corporate sector nearly quadrupled. Further, newspaper headlines told us that the 
corporate profits-to-GDP ratio rose to a 15-year high in FY24. BusinessLine reported, “The 
corporate profit for the Nifty-500 universe was up 30 per cent last fiscal to ₹14.11-lakh crore 
against ₹10.88 lakh crore in FY23. The nominal GDP grew 9.6 per cent y-o-y to ₹295-lakh crore 
(₹269-lakh crore)1”. Hiring and compensation growth hardly kept up with it. But, it is in the 
interest of the companies to step up hiring and worker compensation.
The Union government cut taxes in September 2019 to facilitate capital formation. Has the 
corporate sector responded? Between FY19 and FY23, the cumulative growth in private sector 
non-financial Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is 52% in current prices. During the same 
period, the cumulative growth in general government (which includes states) is 64%. The gap 
does not appear to be too wide.
However, when we break it down, a different picture emerges. Private sector GFCF in 
machinery and equipment and intellectual property products has grown cumulatively by only 
35% in the four years to FY23. Meanwhile, its GFCF in ‘Dwellings, other buildings and structures’ 
has increased by 105%. This is not a healthy mix. Second, the slow pace of investment in M&E 
and IP Products will delay India’s quest to raise the manufacturing share of GDP, delay the 
improvement in India’s manufacturing competitiveness, and create only a smaller number of 
higher-quality formal jobs than otherwise.
Nonetheless, there is a silver lining in the data. In the two years since FY21, GFCF by the 
private sector has grown faster. General government GFCF rose a cumulative 42% between 
FY21 and FY23. Non-Financial Private Sector’s overall GFCF increased by 51%; investment 
in Machinery and Equipment and Intellectual Property Products increased by 38%. So, the 
growth in these two critical sub-components of Private Sector GFCF is similar to that of the 
overall GFCF by the General Government. This is a statistic that bears watching. They should 
continue to invest. To do so, they need demand visibility. That comes from employment and 
income growth. 
In a recent article,2 the Economist cites independent research that predicted a slow demise 
of India’s services exports over the next decade. While the boom in telecommunications and 
the rise of the internet facilitated business process outsourcing, the next wave of technological 
evolution might bring the curtains down on it. In this milieu, the corporate sector has a 
responsibility, as much to itself as it is to society, to think harder about ways AI will augment 
labour rather than displace workers. Hiring in the IT sector has slowed significantly in the last 
two years. We do not have a full picture of overall corporate hiring in the country on a regular

basis. In any case, deploying capital-intensive and energy-intensive AI is probably one of the 
last things a growing, lower-middle-income economy needs. 
A Staff Discussion Note of the International Monetary Fund published in June 20243 
notes that Generative Artificial Intelligence raised profound concerns about massive labour 
disruptions and inequality. The IMF SDN goes on to recommend well-designed excess corporate 
profit taxes and high personal income taxes on capital through better enforcement of automatic 
information exchange between countries and enhanced taxation of capital gains. However, 
employment is about dignity, self-worth, self-esteem, self-respect, and standing in the family 
and community, not just about the income it brings. That is why it is in the enlightened self-
interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to 
create jobs seriously. Of course, it must find people with the right attitude and skills. 
That requires another tripartite compact - between the government, the private sector and 
academia. This compact is to reboot the mission to skill and equip Indians to catch up with and 
get ahead of technological evolution. To succeed in the mission, governments must unshackle 
the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task. 
For example, despite several amendments over the years, the Apprenticeship Act remains a 
work in progress, at best, in encouraging large-scale apprenticeships in the country. The New 
Education Policy 2020 proposes freeing India’s higher education from regulatory oversight 
to market oversight. A corporate sector that helps shape the design of higher education with 
inputs to curriculum, evaluation standards, and faculty will pave the way for a high-quality 
higher education that market competition brings, replacing regulatory oversight. If anything, 
another article4 in The Economist that hails the arrival of China as a superpower in science 
should be sufficient inspiration for the corporate sector and academia to get their act together 
on scientific research and development.
The real corporate social responsibility
The role of the corporate sector has never been greater than it is now. Two other areas of 
corporate responsibility deserve mention here. The pandemic saw the emergence of the Indian 
retail investor as the bulwark of market stability. The culture of investing for the long term has 
to be nurtured and sustained. Market practices that take their cues from the thinly disguised 
leveraged bets masquerading as financial innovations in the developed world have no place 
in a developing country with a low per-capita income. Second, just as corporate profits are 
booming, the net interest margin of Indian banks has risen to a multi-year high. It is a good 
thing. Profitable banks lend more. To sustain the good times, it is important not to forget the 
lessons of the last financial cycle downturn. The banking industry must aim to lengthen the gap 
between two NPA cycles. It should also resist the temptation to pursue short-term profits at the 
expense of the customer. Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of 
a few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. 
Prompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary 
to increase insurance penetration. Acknowledgement of misselling and misrepresentation and 
compensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, 
fund management, banking and insurance firms. 
Corporates benefit from the higher demand generated by employment and income growth. 
The financial sector benefits from channelling household savings for investment purposes.

These linkages must grow stronger and last longer to meet the infrastructure and energy 
transition investments in the coming decades. Short-termism can weaken these linkages.
For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good 
health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits, and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that 
can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential. The 
private sector’s contribution to this toxic mix of habits is substantial, and that is myopic. The 
emerging food consumption habits of Indians are not only unhealthy but also environmentally 
unsustainable. India’s traditional lifestyle, food and recipes have shown how to live healthily 
and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for 
Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to 
be led rather than tapped.
Governments, on their part…
Policymakers – elected or appointed – have to rise to the challenge as well. There has to 
be conversation, cooperation, collaboration, and coordination across ministries, states, and 
between the union and states. Few people outside the government – living or dead – can 
understand the complexity of governing and transforming a nation of India’s (population) size, 
(geographical) spread and social and cultural diversity within a democratic framework. The 
political class, with its ears to the ground and the civil service, with its exposure to districts, 
states and central Ministries, have a better shot at (at least) a partial understanding of this 
complexity. They intuitively know there is no place for exclusive approaches and binary choices, 
which are the staple of sterile discussions and discourses. Examples are urban vs. rural, growth 
vs. equity or development, and manufacturing vs. services. They intuitively know that India 
needs multiple development pathways. That is a good thing. But it is easier said than done. It 
has not been done before. Not on this scale. Not in the time frame and not amidst a turbulent 
global environment. Forging and sustaining  consensus between governments, businesses and 
the social sectors are necessary to succeed in this endeavour.
Agriculture can be a growth engine if…
The agriculture sector is one area ripe for and in need of such a pan-India dialogue. 
Agriculture and farmers matter for a nation. Most countries understand that. India is no 
exception. India subsidises their water, electricity and fertilisers. The former two are provided 
virtually free. Their incomes are not taxed. The government offers them a minimum support 
price (MSP) for 23 selected commodities. Monthly cash support is offered to farmers through 
the PM-KISAN scheme. Indian governments – national and sub-national –write off their loans. 
So, governments in India spend enough resources to look after the farmers well. Yet, a case can 
be made that they can be served better with some re-orientation of existing and new policies.
A panoply of policies – by national and sub-national governments - working at cross-
purposes with each other is hurting farmers’ interests, destroying soil fertility, depleting 
groundwater, polluting rivers and the environment with nitrous oxide emissions, starving the 
crops of nutrients and undermining people’s health with a diet rich in sugar and carbohydrates 
rather than fibre and protein. The payoff will be immense if we untie the knots that bedevil farm 
sector policies. More than anything else, it will restore faith in the self-confidence and ability of 
the state to steer the nation to a better future, apart from delivering socio-economic benefits. 
Earlier development models featured economies migrating from farm beginnings to 
industrialisation to value-added services in their development journey. Technological 
advancements and geopolitics are challenging this conventional wisdom. Trade protectionism, 

xii
resource-hoarding, excess capacity and dumping, onshoring production and the advent of AI 
are narrowing the scope for countries to squeeze out growth from manufacturing and services. 
That is forcing us to turn conventional wisdom on its head. Can the farm sector be the saviour? 
A return to roots, as it were, in terms of farming practices and policymaking, can generate 
higher value addition from agriculture, boost farmers’ income, create opportunities for food 
processing and exports and make the farm sector both fashionable and productive for India’s 
urban youth. When resolved, the problem areas mentioned above that the current policy 
configuration has created over the years can become sources of India’s strength and a model 
for the rest of the world - developing and developed. 
Unleashing small enterprises
Another area where policy intentions have yet to manifest in desired outcomes is with respect 
to small, medium, and large enterprises. Earlier, several products were reserved for small-
scale industries. That was phased out as it benefitted neither the small-scale industries nor the 
overall economy. Recent concerted efforts at formalising them are making progress. Progress 
is relatively slower on access to finance. Buyers and creditors are shedding old mindsets and 
practices too slowly for these enterprises to feel the effect. However, these enterprises need 
maximum relief from the compliance burdens they face. Laws, rules and regulations stretch 
their finances, abilities and bandwidth, perhaps robbing them of the will to grow. 
Successful Energy transition is an orchestra
Other priorities, such as energy transition and mobility, may pale compared to the 
complexity of getting the farm sector policies right. Still, they have one thing in common with it. 
They require getting many things across several ministries and states aligned. The list is long. 
Energy transition and mobility issues require attention in the following areas:
(a) resource dependence on hostile nations;
(b)	technological challenges such as intermittency of power generation, ensuring grid 
stability amidst surges and drop in generation from renewable energy sources and 
battery storage
(c) recognition of the opportunity cost of tying up land in a land-scarce country;
(d) fiscal implications that involve both additional expenditures for subsidising renewable 
energy generation and for e-mobility solutions, loss of tax and freight revenue currently 
accruing from the sale and transportation of fossil fuels;
(e) impairment to bank balance sheets from the so-called ‘stranded assets’ and
(f)	 examination of the merits of alternative mobility solutions such as public transportation 
models and more. 
Emulating policy practices of other nations may be neither feasible nor desirable, for 
solutions may not emerge from approaches and places that created the problems in the first 
place.
Letting go is part of good governance
While contemplating the challenges that lie ahead, one should not be daunted because the 
social and economic transformation of democratic India is a remarkable success story. We have 
come a long way. The economy has grown from around USD288 billion in FY93 to USD3.6 
trillion in FY23. India has generated more growth per dollar of debt than other comparable 
nations. Abject poverty has all but been eliminated. Human development indicators have 

xiii
improved, and more Indians, especially women, are getting educated. For all its flaws and warts, 
the system has delivered accountability through the democratic process and public discourse, 
where the occasional and rarer mature commentary proves effective. We should not lose sight 
of that. 
However, it would be a missed opportunity - as there have been many in the past - not 
to strengthen a system to steer the country through a future that has become immeasurably 
uncertain. After nearly eight decades of relative peace at the global level, the world is moving 
towards a larger and wider conflict with longer-term effects. The Indian state can free up its 
capacity and enhance its capability to focus on areas where it has to by letting go of its grip in 
areas where it does not have to. The Licensing, Inspection and Compliance requirements that 
all levels of the government continue to impose on businesses is an onerous burden. Relative 
to history, the burden has lightened. Relative to where it ought to be, it is still a lot heavier. The 
burden is felt more acutely by those least equipped to bear it – small and medium enterprises. 
It holds them back, leashes their aspirations, and, in the process, holds the country back. On 
the face of it, it does not seem to matter because the economic growth rates are good, and there 
are visible signs of progress. But, we will never know the counterfactual: “what it might have 
been”. 
Ishopanishad enjoins all of us to let go of (renounce) our possessions, be free and enjoy that 
freedom:
ईशा वास्यमिदं सर्वं यत्किञ्च जगत्यां जगत्।
तेन त्यक्तेन भुञ्जीथा मा गृधः कस्यस्विद्धनम्॥
Power is a prized possession of governments. They can let go of at least some of it and enjoy 
the lightness it creates in both the governed and the governing.
Finally,…
The tripartite compact that this country needs to become a developed nation amidst 
emerging unprecedented global challenges is for governments to trust and let go, for the private 
sector to reciprocate the trust with long-term thinking and fair conduct and for the public to 
take responsibility for their finances and their physical and mental health.
The Economic Survey 2023-24 covers many of the issues discussed above in its several 
chapters, apart from informing readers of government policies and their performance, their 
impacts, innovations, developments and success stories worth emulating. As before, the staple 
content of the Survey is chapters that provide an assessment of the various sectors such as 
agriculture, industry, infrastructure and services.
For us in the Economics Division in the Department of Economic Affairs, putting the 
Economic Survey together and getting it into your hands or electronic devices is a labour of 
love. Recording and sharing the country’s progress in the year under review and reflecting on 
what it must do and must not to achieve the progress it deserves is a learning experience for us. 
In doing so, we may have made mistakes. Please do tell us. We promise to keep getting better 
at it. Ultimately, that is all we can and should ask of ourselves.

CHAPTER
01
STATE OF THE ECONOMY: 
STEADY AS SHE GOES
India’s calibrated response to the pandemic on the economic front included three salient 
components. The first has been the focus on public spending on infrastructure, which 
kept the economy afloat by creating a strong demand for jobs and industrial output 
and triggered a lagged yet vigorous private investment response. Stronger balance 
sheets of the financial and non-financial private sector helped, aided by a decade of 
supporting initiatives by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. The second has 
been partly a natural response of business enterprise and public administration amidst 
adversities, i.e., digitalisation of service delivery. The public policy focus and nurturing 
of processes and frameworks in digital technology greatly helped this irreversible and 
transformational change. The third has been embodied in the Atmanirbhar Bharat 
Abhiyan in terms of targeted relief to different sectors of the economy and sections of 
the population, and structural reforms that assisted a firm recovery and increased the 
medium-term growth potential. 
Global troubles, supply chain disruptions, and vagaries of monsoons intermittently 
stoked domestic inflationary pressures, which were, to a great extent, managed by 
administrative and monetary policy responses.  The fiscal balances of the general 
government—central and State Governments taken together - have improved 
progressively despite expansionary public investment. Tax compliance gains driven 
by procedural reforms, expenditure restraint, and increasing digitisation helped 
India achieve this fine balance. The external balance has been pressured by subdued 
global demand for goods, but strong services exports largely counterbalanced this. 
Global output is now somewhat more resilient than in 2022, inflationary pressures are 
shrinking, and trade is set to recover, should there be no further geo-political shocks 
or flare-ups. However, the chances of geopolitical disturbances and conflicts have only 
gone up in recent times.
The net impact of these developments has been that the Indian economy recovered and 
expanded in an orderly fashion in the last three years. The real GDP in FY24 was 20 
per cent higher than its level in FY20, a feat that only a very few major economies 
achieved, while also leaving a strong possibility for robust growth in FY25 and beyond. 
Growth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional 
poverty and an increase in labour force participation. Overall, the Indian economy 
looks forward to FY25 optimistically, anticipating broad-based and inclusive growth.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC SCENARIO
1.1	
After a year marked by global uncertainties and volatilities, the global economy achieved 
greater stability in 2023. While uncertainty stemming from adverse geopolitical developments 
remained elevated, global economic growth was surprisingly robust. As per the World Economic 
Outlook (WEO), April 2024 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)1, the global economy 
registered a growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023, though marginally lower than in 20222  and average

for 2011-19 but higher compared to the projection of 2.8 per cent as per the April 2023 WEO5. 
The context in which the growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023 has been achieved is markedly different 
compared to the 2011-19 period. Inflationary pressures have been significantly higher on 
account of the persistence of core inflation. Global trade moderated due to rising geopolitical 
tensions, cross-border restrictions and slower growth in advanced economies (AEs). The 
muted trade growth occurred despite the easing of supply chain pressures. Further, geopolitical 
developments and monetary policy changes across countries resulted in increased caution 
among investors, culminating in moderation in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.

Both emerging market economies (EMEs) and AEs achieved higher growth in 2023 than 
projected a year ago.  Almost all major economies have surpassed the pre Covid-19 pandemic 
(hereinafter as pandemic) real gross domestic product (GDP) levels in 2023. However, growth 
has been diverse across countries, raising prospects of increasing divergences. Some economies, 
including India and China, have attained GDP levels 20 per cent higher in 2023 compared to 
2019 levels. Among AEs, the US witnessed continued growth momentum. However, economic 
activity remains subdued in the Euro area, although the magnitude of the downturn has eased.
1.3	
The stark difference in the economic performance of countries has been on account 
of domestic structural issues, uneven exposure to geopolitical conflicts and the impact of 
monetary policy tightening. The economic shocks resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
had an outsized impact on Europe, leading to subdued growth in large countries like Germany 
and France. The US also faced high inflationary pressures and consequently raised the policy 
rates substantially. But, the pass-through to outstanding household mortgages was limited on 
account of the high share of fixed-rate mortgages and corporate debt being termed out at fixed

rates6, limiting the impact of higher policy rates on economic activity7. India registered a steep 
decline in economic growth during the pandemic but recovered swiftly, aided by strong private 
consumption and government impetus to infrastructure investment. China, on the other hand, 
had only a slight moderation in growth during the pandemic on account of swift policy actions, 
including a high vaccination rate8, but growth has slowed subsequently due to structural issues. 
Japan, post-pandemic, went through subdued growth but is expected to turn around in 2024, 
driven by a weak yen and improved consumer spending.

Apart from GDP estimates, other indicators tracking the performance of the economy 
also point towards growth resilience. Leading indicators suggest an upturn in global economic 
activity. The JP Morgan global composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)9 registered an 
uptick since October 2023 with quicker expansion across both manufacturing and service 
sectors. The JP Morgan global manufacturing PMI has been improving and stood at a 23-month 
high in May 202410.

The escalation of the Red Sea crisis amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East in October 2023 led to supply chain disruptions, sending ripples to global trade 
and operations. The attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea led to increased global 
transportation costs, reflecting the rerouting of cargo. However, the increase in supply chain 
pressures was transient and modest. Similar sentiments were reflected in the softening of 
risk perceptions. The geopolitical risk index, which spiked after the escalation of the conflict, 
declined thereafter.  However, geopolitical risks are still high and persistent and may worsen in 
the coming months.

in 2022, inflationary pressures declined considerably in 2023. However, inflation is still above 
the target in many countries. The easing of supply-chain pressures in tradeable goods in 2023 
led to sharp decline in goods inflation in various countries, reducing logistic challenges. Core 
inflation remained sticky on account of services inflation and a strong labour market, especially 
in most AEs.12

The persistence of core inflation prompted many central banks to maintain policy rates at 
a high level or further increase them in 2023, except in China, where the government focussed 
on giving policy stimulus to revive the economy beset with troubles in the real estate sector. 
Many central banks have hinted at the peaking of the interest rate hike cycle in recent monetary

policy review meetings. European Central Bank (ECB) became the first major central bank to 
cut its policy rate, invoking the first rate cut in nearly five years. ECB lowered its benchmark 
deposit rate by a quarter percentage point in June 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) participants’ assessments also indicated rate cuts in 2024, though the projected 
interest rate cut in the latest FOMC meeting (June 2024)13  is lower than that projected in 
March 2023. Stronger-than-expected labour market data and persistent inflationary pressures 
have been a major factor behind the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed) reluctance to lower rates. As 
indicated in the FOMC Meeting statements, from early January 2024 onwards, communication 
by the Fed increasingly pushed back to dispel excessive market optimism. However, market 
pricing of various financial instruments indicates greater investor conviction in earlier and 
deeper rate cuts. This is reflected in the inversion of the yield curve (short-term yields are 
higher than long-term yields), implying investor expectation of future policy rate cuts. Financial 
market participants have also eyed a much easier stance, as reflected in the significant easing 
of National Financial Conditions in the US in 2023 compared to March 2022, when the Fed 
began raising rates. Expansionary fiscal policy and the easing of financial conditions have, to 
a degree, neutralised the monetary policy tightening of the Fed, leaving unanswered questions 
on the future trajectory of inflation and the US dollar.

Despite strong global economic growth, as per the WEO data, the global volume of exports 
of goods and services registered a modest growth of 0.5 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022. 
The slow growth was driven by lower demand in developed economies and weaker trade in East 
Asia and Latin America (UNCTAD March Update 2024)16. High energy prices and inflation 
weighed heavily on the demand for manufactured goods, resulting in a decline in world 
merchandise trade volume for 2023. On the other hand, developments in the services trade were 
more upbeat, partly offsetting the decline in goods trade (WEO, IMF Database, April 2024). 
Recurring disruptions, especially since the Russia-Ukraine crisis and increased concerns about 
supply-chain resilience also contributed to the slowdown. There is a reallocation of trade along 
geopolitical lines, with rising cross-border trade restrictions. About 3,000 new restrictions on 
trade were introduced in 2023, according to Global Trade Alert data (IMF, WEO, April 2024)17. 
1.10	 Concerns regarding geopolitical conflicts, high borrowing costs and global economic 
fracturing were also reflected in weakening FDI flows. Global FDI flows declined in 2023 
compared to 202218.

A RESILIENT DOMESTIC ECONOMY
1.11	 India’s economy carried forward the momentum it built in FY23 into FY24 despite a gamut 
of global and external challenges. The focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability ensured 
that these challenges had minimal impact on India’s economy. As a result, India’s real GDP grew 
by 8.2 per cent in FY24, posting growth of over 7 per cent for a third consecutive year, driven by 
stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand. On the supply side, 
gross value added (GVA) at 2011-12 prices grew by 7.2 per cent in FY24, with growth remaining 
broad-based. Net taxes at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 19.1 per cent in FY24, aided by 
reasonably strong tax growth, both at the centre and state levels and rationalisation of subsidy 
expenditure. This led to the difference between GDP and GVA growth in FY24.

1.12	 The shares of the agriculture, industry and services sector in overall GVA at current prices 
were 17.7 per cent, 27.6 per cent and 54.7 per cent respectively in FY24. GVA in the agriculture 
sector continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Erratic weather patterns during the year 
and an uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon in 2023 impacted overall output. This is 
reflected in the marginal decline in total foodgrain output for FY24 of 0.3 per cent as per the 
third advanced estimate of foodgrain production released by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Farmers’ Welfare (MoAFW).19

1.13	 Within the industrial sector, manufacturing GVA shrugged off a disappointing FY23 and 
grew by 9.9 per cent in FY24. Manufacturing activities benefitted from reduced input prices 
while catering to stable domestic demand. The input price advantage was reflected in the 
subdued growth in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, which led to a deflator of (-)1.7 
per cent for the manufacturing sector during FY24. Manufacturers also passed on the reduction 
in input prices to consumers, reflected in the sustained decline in the core consumer price 
inflation. The strength of manufacturing is further corroborated by the strong performance of 
the HSBC India PMI for manufacturing, which consistently remained well above the threshold 
value of 50, indicating sustained expansion and stability in India's manufacturing sector. 
Construction activities displayed increased momentum and registered a growth of 9.9 per cent 
in FY24 due to the infrastructure buildout and buoyant commercial and residential real estate 
demand. 
1.14	 Various high-frequency indicators reflect the growth in the services sector. Both Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) collections and the issuance of e-way bills, reflecting wholesale and 
retail trade, demonstrated double-digit growth in FY24. Financial and professional services

have been a major driver of growth post the pandemic. Contact-intensive services—prominently 
trade, transport, real estate and their ancillary services that were impacted the most during 
the pandemic have emerged much stronger in the post-pandemic period, embedding greater 
technology and digital content in them and transforming the nature of the service delivery 
in India. The proliferation of global capability centres (GCCs) has also imparted resilience to 
India's services exports, giving further thrust to the sector.
1.15	 On the demand side, private consumption has been a crucial and steadfast cog in the 
GDP growth. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) grew by 4.0 per cent in real terms 
in FY24. Urban demand conditions remain strong, as reflected in various urban consumption 
indicators such as domestic passenger vehicle sales20 and air passenger traffic21. It is also reported 
that rural consumption growth has gradually picked up pace during the quarter ending March 
2024.22  As per the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, two and three-wheeler and 
passenger vehicle sales also registered an uptick in FY24.

1.16	 Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) continues to emerge as an important driver 
of growth, as indicated in its rising share of nominal GDP. India is in the midst of a private 
capex upcycle that has been aided by government capital expenditure. As per Statement 1.11 
of the National Accounts Statistics 2024 released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation (MoSPI), GFCF by private non-financial corporations increased by 19.8 per 
cent in FY23. There are early signs that the momentum in private capital formation has been 
sustained in FY24. As per data provided by Axis Bank Research, private investment across a 
consistent set of over 3,200 listed and unlisted non-financial firms has grown by 19.8 per cent 
in FY24.

1.17	 Apart from private corporations, households have also been at the forefront of the capital 
formation process. The growth in housing sales in cities has been particularly impressive, 
indicating that urban households are diversifying the deployment of their savings. In 2023, 
residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing a 33 per cent 
YoY growth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. As per real estate research 
firm Proptiger, new supply witnessed an all-time high, with 5.2 lakh units launched in 2023, 
as against 4.3 lakh units in 2022. The momentum continued in Q1 of 2024, witnessing record-
breaking sales of 1.2 lakh units, clocking a robust 41 per cent YoY growth. New supply has 
consistently exceeded one lakh units since Q2 of 2022, underscoring persistent demand-supply 
dynamics in the housing market.
1.18	 With cleaner balance sheets and adequate capital buffers, the banking and financial 
sector is well-positioned to cater to the growing financing needs of investment demand. Credit 
disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) to industrial micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) and services continues to grow in double digits despite a higher base. 
Similarly, personal loans for housing have surged, corresponding to the increase in housing 
demand. However, credit offtake by large industries seems to be growing at a lower albeit stable 
pace. These larger industries seem to be tapping the corporate bond market. Corporate bond 
issuances in FY24 were up by 70.5 per cent, with private placement remaining the preferred 
channel for corporates. Outstanding corporate bonds were up by 9.6 per cent (YoY) as of the 
end of March 2024.

1.19	 Global trade growth slowed in 2023, leading to a marginal decline in merchandise exports 
growth. As merchandise imports slowed more than exports and services trade recorded a 
larger surplus compared to the year before, the drag exerted by net exports on GDP reduced. 
The subdued contribution of exports was more than counterbalanced by the pick-up in fixed 
investment, thereby continuing the trend of domestic stimulus seamlessly replacing external 
stimuli.

In the analysis, six key macroeconomic variables at constant (2011-12) prices, i.e., GDP, 
GVA, PFCE, GFCF, industry GVA, and services GVA of quarterly frequency, have been 
deseasonalised using the X-12 ARIMA technique that decomposes variables into its trend, 
seasonal, cyclical, and idiosyncratic components. The deseasonalised variables have been 
visualised to understand where these variables stand vis-à-vis their pre-pandemic trend 
projections. A trend line based on de-seasonalised data between June 2011 and March 
2020 has been plotted and extended until March 2024. This trend reflects the approximate 
projection of the variable in each quarter from June 2020 to March 2024 had the pandemic-
induced contraction of economic activity not occurred.   

Economic Survey 2023-24

The visualisation reveals that GDP, GVA, private consumption, GFCF, and industrial GVA 
have recovered quickly. We see that the compounded quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of these 
variables is greater in the period Q3 FY21 – Q4 FY24 than the CQGR in the pre-pandemic 
period of Q1 FY12 – Q4 FY20 (Table I.). This enabled a broad catch-up to the levels projected 
by the pre-pandemic trends, thereby averting any permanent losses in demand/output. The 
reasons for this are manifold. The pandemic-induced contraction presented an opportunity 
for the deployment of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy that focussed on capital expenditure, 
thereby positioning government-driven capital formation as a driver of growth. It also 
enabled the implementation of multiple process reforms and the deployment of public digital 
infrastructure that boosted the ease of doing business. The pandemic also accelerated the 
adoption of digital technologies amongst the population and enhanced financial inclusion. 
With the GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) acting as tailwinds to the 
economy, growth took off.

GVA of the services sector is yet to reach the level projected by the pre-pandemic trend. The 
granular data available until FY23 reveals that this is on account of the trade, hotel, road and 
air transport sectors. These sectors, taken together, contributed about 28.5 per cent to total 
real GVA in FY23 and were only one per cent above their levels in FY20.   
Chart I.27 reveals that the gap between GDP and its pre-pandemic trend has been closing, 
and GDP was only around 1 per cent below this trend on an annual average basis in FY24. 
There is still some catching up left. The extant momentum in growth not only allows the 
economy to catch up with its pre-pandemic trend without stoking inflationary pressures but 
aids in surpassing it.
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY SAFEGUARDS GROWTH
1.21	 For India, FY23 began with multiple challenges. Spillovers from the conflict in Europe 
were stoking domestic price pressures and widening the current account deficit (CAD) through 
increased oil prices. Central banks in several countries began raising policy rates to battle 
inflationary pressures, leading to significant uncertainty in AEs and EMEs alike. However, 
throughout FY23 and FY24, the focus on macroeconomic stability was vital in securing 
economic growth amidst domestic and external vulnerabilities. 

State of the Economy

Improving Public Finances
Consolidation of Union Government Finances
1.22	 Against the global trend of widening fiscal deficit and increasing debt burden, India has 
remained on the course of fiscal consolidation. The favourable fiscal performance in 2023, 
emerged as the cornerstone of India’s macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit of the Union 
Government has been brought down from 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 5.6 per cent of GDP 
in FY24, according to provisional actuals (PA) data released by the Office of Controller General 
of Accounts (CGA). Strong growth in direct and indirect taxes on account of resilient economic 
activity and increased compliance meant that the tax revenues generated exceeded the 
conservative budgetary estimates. Additionally, higher-than-budgeted non-tax revenue in the 
form of dividends from the RBI has buffeted revenue receipts. In combination with restrained 
revenue expenditure, these buoyant revenues ensured lower deficits. A decomposition of the 
fiscal deficit over the past few years reveals that with a narrowing revenue deficit, a larger share 
of the fiscal deficit is being accounted for by capital outlay. This suggests that the productivity 
of borrowed resources has improved.

Buoyancy in revenues continues in FY24
1.23	 Significant fiscal consolidation post-pandemic could be achieved largely due to buoyant 
revenues. Revenue receipts of the union government consisting of tax revenue (net to centre) 
and non-tax revenue (NTR) increased YoY by 14.5 per cent in FY24 (PA), with robust growth in 
both tax and non-tax revenues.

1.24	 The growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) was estimated to be 13.4 per cent in FY24, 
translating into tax revenue buoyancy of 1.4. The growth was led by a 15.8 per cent growth in 
direct taxes and a 10.6 per cent increase in indirect taxes over FY23. Broadly, 55 per cent of 
GTR accrued from direct taxes and the remaining 45 per cent from indirect taxes. The increased 
contribution of direct taxes to GTR over the years has been in line with the government’s effort 
to enhance progressivity in taxation. The efficiency of tax collection has increased over time, 
reflected in the cost of collection of direct taxes declining from 0.66 per cent of gross collections 
in FY20 to 0.51 per cent in FY2326.

1.25	 The increase in indirect taxes in FY24 was mainly driven by a 12.7 per cent growth in GST 
collection. GST E-way bill generated has also registered an uptick post-pandemic. The increase 
has been equally pronounced for both intra-state trade and inter-state trade. The increase in 
GST collection and E-way bill generation reflects increased compliance over time.

1.26	 Over the last seven years, GST has matured significantly through streamlining of 
procedures and, in the process, enhancing tax buoyancy for the Union and State governments. 
There have been calls for further rationalisation of rate structure to compress the number of 
rates, elimination of rate inversions, introduction of broad-band rates for similar products and 
expanding the tax base. Demands also relate to differentiating between serious and less serious 
offences, spreading awareness among taxpayers regarding common mistakes, encouraging 
voluntary compliance and expediting the resolution of disputes.27
1.27	 Within non-debt capital receipts, the proceeds from the National Monetisation Pipeline 
(NMP), which was announced in the Union Budget FY22, are gaining traction. The NMP listed 
core assets of union government ministries and public sector enterprises with a potential of 
₹6 lakh crore for monetisation over the four-year period of FY22 – FY25. During FY22 - FY24, 
receipts worth ₹3.9 lakh crore have been recorded as against a target of ₹4.3 lakh crore.28 The 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the Ministry of Coal contributed ₹97 thousand 
crore out of proceeds worth ₹1.6 lakh crore in FY24. The National Highways Authority of India 
has identified and published an indicative list of 33 assets to be monetised in FY25. This will 
help improve capital allocation by investors while aiding the government in its pursuit of fiscal 
consolidation.   
Trends in Central Government Expenditure
1.28	 The government has followed a path of fiscal consolidation while continuing to protect 
the vulnerable sections and investing in the productive capacity of the economy. Successive

budgets moderated the growth in revenue expenditure. While achieving the compression in 
revenue expenditure as a per cent of GDP, the government also ensured that free food grains 
are provided to 81.4 crore people in the country. At the same time, shares of total expenditure 
allotted to capital spending were progressively enhanced, thereby improving the quality 
of expenditure. Government expenditure in FY24 continued this trend whereby, as per the 
provisional actuals, total expenditure declined to 15.0 per cent of GDP from 17.7 per cent in FY21.

29  Effective Capex includes capex and Grants-in-Aid for creation of capital assets.

Capex has lifted the productive potential of the economy; time for the private 
sector to take the baton
1.29	 The PA show that capital expenditure for FY24 stood at ₹9.5 lakh crore, an increase of 
28.2 per cent on a YoY basis, and was 2.8 times the level of FY20. The Government’s thrust on 
capex has been a critical driver of economic growth amidst an uncertain and challenging global 
environment. 
1.30	 The focus of capex has been broad-based. Spending in sectors such as road transport 
and highways, railways, defence services, and telecommunications delivers higher and longer 
impetuses to growth by addressing logistical bottlenecks and expanding productive capacities. 
Government capex has also begun to crowd in private investment, as discussed earlier in this 
chapter. Additionally, the Government continues to disburse grants-in-aid for the creation of 
capital assets to the states, thereby incentivising them to increase their productive spending. 
1.31	 At this juncture, it is important to note that while it remains the government’s responsibility 
to facilitate the development of infrastructure and address logistical challenges, it is incumbent 
upon the private sector to take forward the momentum in capital formation on its own and in 
partnership with the Government. Between FY19 and FY23, the share of private non-financial 
corporations in overall GFCF increased only by 0.8 percentage points from 34.1 per cent to 
34.9 per cent. This was mostly driven by their fast-increasing share in the additional stock of 
dwellings, other buildings and structures. Their share in addition to the capital stock in terms 
of machinery and equipment, started growing robustly only since FY22, a trend that needs to 
be sustained on the strength of their improving bottom-line and balance sheets in order to 
generate high-quality jobs.

Revenue expenditure growth remains restrained 
1.32	 The PA show that total expenditure for FY24 is lower by ₹60.6 thousand crore as 
compared to the budgeted estimates. However, these lower-than-budgeted estimates have not 
resulted in compromises on important areas of revenue spending, such as rural development 
and education, where allocation is significantly higher than budgeted estimates. Efficient 
expenditure management, aided by lower borrowing costs, has led to a marginal downward 
revision of budgeted expenditure on interest payments in FY24. 
1.33	 However, even though expenditure on interest payments is lower than budgeted, it 
constitutes 30.4 per cent of the revenue expenditure in FY24 (PA). A commitment to fiscal 
consolidation in the medium term, combined with revenues from asset monetisation and 
privatisation, will be essential in reducing the share of interest payments in revenue expenditure 
in order to generate more fiscal headroom.
1.34	 Expenditure on major subsidies declined by 22.1 per cent on a YoY basis, led by a decrease 
in fertiliser30 and food subsidies by 24.6 per cent and 22.4 per cent, respectively, in FY24. The 
prices of fertilisers had steeply increased in FY23 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, prompting 
a higher outlay for its subsidy. However, in FY24, the supply chains adapted, and as a result, the 
prices of fertilisers have broadly returned to pre-conflict levels. This facilitated a lower outlay 
on fertiliser subsidies. The additional food subsidy, instituted to protect vulnerable sections of 
the population, has been gradually consolidating as well.  
Overview of State Government Finances
1.35	 State governments continued to improve their finances in FY24. Preliminary unaudited 
estimates of finances for a set of 23 states31, published by the Comptroller and Auditor General 
of India, suggest that the gross fiscal deficit of these 23 states was 8.6 per cent lower than the 
budgeted figure of ₹9.1 lakh crore.32 This implies that fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP for these 
states came in at 2.8 per cent as against a budgeted 3.1 per cent. The quality of spending by state 
governments improved, too, with state governments focusing on capex as well.

Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab,

1.36	 Charts I.46 through I.49 encapsulate states’ finances33. The Union Government’s transfers 
to the states are highly progressive, with states with lower Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) 
per capita receiving higher transfers relative to their GSDP. On the revenue side, however, 
the richer states, with certain exceptions, are able to mobilise a greater proportion of their 
GSDP as taxes. The combined result of these dynamics on the receipts side is that poorer states 
are enabled to incur greater public spending relative to their GSDP with the system of fiscal

General Government Debt
1.37	 In the years since the pandemic, the Union Government and the State Governments in 
general have focussed on fiscal consolidation, which was reflected in the declining debt trajectory 
of the government till FY23. The general government debt to GDP ratio increased slightly in 
FY24 despite a declining primary deficit because monetary tightening led to a spike in interest 
rates, while the decline in inflationary pressures resulted in a lower-than-budgeted nominal 
GDP growth. However, with the increased prospects of monetary policy easing, along with an 
uptick in WPI inflation and the government’s continued commitment to fiscal consolidation, 
the debt ratio is likely to resume its declining trend.

1.38	 Union Government debt is characterised by low currency and interest rate risks. This is 
owing to the low share of external debt in the debt portfolio and almost all external borrowings 
being from official sources. The gradual elongation of the maturity profile of the Union 
Government’s debt is leading to reduced rollover risks. The proportion of dated securities

maturing in less than five years has seen a consistent decline in recent years. The weighted 
average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the Government has increased 
from 9.6 years in end-March 2011 to 12.5 years in end-March 2024.36
1.39	 The sustained improvement in fiscal metrics is beginning to have an impact on India’s 
credit ratings. For the first time in 13 years, S&P Global Ratings upgraded India's sovereign 
credit rating outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘positive’ in May 2024 on the back of robust economic 
growth, sound economic fundamentals and improved composition of government spending. 
S&P mentioned that cautious monetary and fiscal policy that diminishes general government 
debt and interest burden while improving economic resilience could lead to a higher rating over 
the next two years. The agency further indicated that such an update would require continued 
commitment to fiscal consolidation in a manner that reduces general government deficits to 
below 7 per cent on a structural basis. If that were to happen, India’s 10-year benchmark bond 
yield will drop between 30 and 50 basis points. The drop in the benchmark borrowing cost 
will cause interest rates to decline in general, leading to overall lower cost of borrowing for 
households and businesses. That would be a fiscal stimulus in itself. 
Moderation in inflation pressure
1.40	 Despite global supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions, domestic 
inflationary pressures moderated in FY24. After averaging 6.7 per cent in FY23, retail inflation 
declined to 5.4 per cent in FY24. This has been due to the combination of measures undertaken 
by the Government and the RBI. The Union Government undertook prompt measures such as 
open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, timely imports, reduced the prices of Liquified 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders and implemented a cut in petrol and diesel prices. The RBI 
raised policy rates by a cumulative 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023. It also 
managed liquidity levels efficiently and maintained consistent and coherent communication 
with market participants. Even as higher policy rates are transmitted through the system, the 
RBI continues to support growth with adequate liquidity, thereby ensuring that inflation is 
headed to the target of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The effects of these measures are reflected 
in the latest data on CPI inflation – headline CPI inflation of 5.1 per cent in June 2024, and core 
inflation declined to 3.1 per cent. Consequently, India was the only country amongst its peers 
to traverse a high-growth and low-inflation path in the period FY22 – FY24 (Chart I.53). This is 
despite the fact that there were pressures on the food inflation front, driven by adverse weather 
conditions.

The financial system remains resilient
1.41	 The RBI’s vigil over the banking and financial system and its prompt regulatory actions 
ensure that the system can withstand any macroeconomic or systemic shock. Data from the 
RBI’s Financial Stability Report of June 2024 show that the asset quality of SCBs has improved, 
with the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio declining to 2.8 per cent in March 2024, a 
12-year low. The system-wide capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) declined marginally 
by 37 basis points (bps) over FY24 due to an RBI-mandated revision of risk weights but 
remained well above the regulatory threshold. The profitability of SCBs remained steady, with 
the return on equity and return on assets ratios at 13.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively, as 
of March 2024. Macro stress tests also reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with minimum 
capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. 
1.42	 The RBI remains proactive in undertaking regulatory action. In a measure to regulate the 
exuberant growth in the unsecured lending category and preserve financial stability, the RBI 
tightened norms around this portfolio. Growth in unsecured loans was outpacing that in overall 
credit. To tackle this problem, the RBI directed that consumer credit exposure for banks and 
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will attract a risk weight of 125 per cent compared 
to 100 per cent earlier. The risk weight for credit card loans by banks and NBFCs was fixed 
at 150 per cent and 125 per cent, respectively, up from 125 per cent and 100 per cent earlier. 
Prompt regulatory actions shield the banking and financial system from adverse developments 
and instil confidence in market participants. The soundness of the banking system will facilitate 
the financing of productive opportunities and lengthen the financial cycle, both of which are 
necessary to sustain economic growth.  
India’s external sector is safely navigating through uncertainties
1.43	 On the external front, moderation in merchandise exports continued during FY24, mainly

on account of weaker global demand and persistent geopolitical tensions. However, a sharper 
decline in India’s merchandise import growth, owing to declining commodity prices, resulted in 
a lower trade deficit in FY24. However, India's service exports have remained robust, reaching 
a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24. Exports (merchandise and services) in FY24 grew by 
0.15 per cent, while the total imports declined by 4.9 per cent despite a strong domestic market 
demand.37 Net private transfers, mostly comprising remittances from abroad, grew to USD 
106.6 billion in FY24. As a result, the CAD stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during the year, an 
improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23.  
1.44	 Supported by optimism surrounding India’s growth story, progressive policy reform, 
economic stability, fiscal prudence and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust 
FPI inflows in FY24 that helped fund the CAD and aided the RBI in building adequate forex 
reserves. Net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the 
preceding two years. Net FDI inflows, however, witnessed moderation largely as a part of the 
global phenomenon of declining FDI flows on account of increased scepticism. Net FDI inflows 
to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, 
gross FDI inflows moderated by only 0.6 per cent in FY24. The contraction in net inflows was 
primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment.

1.45	 Overall, India’s external sector is being deftly managed with comfortable foreign exchange 
reserves and a stable exchange rate. Forex reserves as of the end of March 2024 were sufficient 
to cover 11 months of projected imports and more than 100 per cent of total external debt. The 
Indian Rupee has also been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers 
in FY24. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators also continued to be benign. External 
debt as a ratio to GDP stood at a low level of 18.7 per cent as of end-March 2024. The ratio of 
foreign exchange reserves to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.

Reduction in macro vulnerability 
1.46	 In its pursuit of fiscal consolidation through efficient and prudent fiscal management, 
the Government continues to stick to the fiscal glide path. The fiscal deficit of the Government 
is expected to drop to 4.5 per cent of GDP or lower by FY26. This commitment has helped 
keep the sovereign debt sustainable, thereby keeping sovereign bond yields and spreads in 
check. All these factors have combined to keep the macroeconomic environment stable and 
provide a platform for sustainable growth. This is reflected in the downward trajectory of the 
macroeconomic vulnerability index – an index constructed by combining India’s fiscal deficit, 
CAD and inflation.

Box I.2: Strengthening the Statistical System
A sound and dynamic statistical system is the cornerstone for an informed citizenry, data-
driven policies and decision-making. Official statistics play a pivotal role in addressing 
societal challenges and promoting inclusive growth. The government is taking many 
steps aimed at strengthening administrative and survey statistics, building capacities and 
improving data quality and timeliness.
MoSPI, the cornerstone
MoSPI is the nodal ministry for the planned and integrated development of the Indian 
statistical system. MoSPI anchors the core statistics by publishing GDP, price and 
volume indices and countrywide surveys of macroeconomic and sectoral importance. The 
Ministry has initiated various new surveys, namely, the annual survey of unincorporated 
sector enterprises, a time-use survey and started a pilot for an annual survey of service 
sector enterprises. MoSPI is also working towards increasing the frequency of PLFS data 
and extending the generation of quarterly estimates for rural areas. Modern IT tools are 
being adopted for improved data capturing and processing. To encourage greater use of 
administrative data, a National Metadata Structure is also being developed. The Unified 
Data Portal project has been envisaged by MoSPI with the objective of creating a centralised 
database and storage system. Ministries are also taking initiatives to enhance the frequency 
of various surveys to make more informed policy decisions. Given India’s 2047 goals, it 
is important for development policy that (a) MoSPI is capacitated fully to produce and 
integrate all required statistics with the desired quality, regularity and timeliness and (b) 
the quality and timeliness of administrative and transactional data of the line Ministries are 
brought to levels that fully facilitate timely course corrections.  
Further steps to strengthen the statistical database
a)	 An extensive exercise for base revision of important economic statistics is being taken 
up at MoSPI. The exercise to change the base year of CPI from 2012 to 2024 has been 
initiated. An Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics has been set up to 
decide on the base year for GDP. It is important that the base year of critical data series like 
the GDP, different price indices and volume indices like Index of Industrial Production 
(IIP) are updated to the most recent feasible year at the earliest. The ongoing efforts 
to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have 
a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation. State-level variants of indices like IIP 
will help understand the emerging geographical patterns. Survey data to help understand 
private sector capital formation at regular intervals will also help policy formulation. 
b)	 The high-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by different 
departments may be linked in such a way that the build-up of prices at each stage from 
the farm gate to the final consumer is quantifiable and monitorable. This will help 
improve the effectiveness of administrative action by the Government to stabilise prices 
of essential food items.

State of the Economy
31
c)	 More than 1.3 crore entities are registered under GST and file returns. The granular GST 
data, if made available, has great potential to analyse the health of businesses, screening 
of loan applications, provide support for cash flow-based lending, and understand the 
economies of different geographies deeply. 
d)	 The XV Finance Commission observes, “The CAG, which is mandated to carry out the 
role of accounts compilation and finalisation for almost all the States, as well as being the 
auditor of both the Union and the States, is already in the process of establishing common 
fiscal data standards. This would eventually ensure the availability of standardised data 
through a public web portal for granular level fiscal statistics of the Union and the States, 
both for historic audited fiscal data and high-frequency fiscal data for the current year in 
downloadable database formats.”39 Granular time series, in database formats, of audited 
accounts of the Union and the States will make fiscal analysis and policy much easier. 
e)	 Regular indicators of the dynamics of production and employment in MSMEs are 
essential, considering their potential for growth and job creation. 
f)	 Information may be published on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as 
opposed to the data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly 
gross financial flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes, and other 
financing sources. 
g)	 There is also a need to have a regular mechanism to aggregate the financial flows to 
infrastructure and physical progress- sectorally and geographically differentiated- 
achieved in different infrastructure sectors, at least on an annual basis. 
h)	 The large volume of data generated by schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya 
Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, which capture details such as hospital 
admissions, patients’ medical history or demographic details. These can be used for 
disease surveillance, preventive medication, etc.
i)	
The Labour Bureau is also tasked with conducting five surveys relating to workers and 
employment. Ensuring rigour, timeliness and user-friendliness of data and making it 
available in database formats will help analysis and policy40.
The thrust on evidence also necessitates that the process and impact evaluation capacities 
in the Union and State Governments and universities are nurtured and driven towards 
maturity in a time-bound manner.
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Shift in the approach to welfare 
1.47	 India’s social welfare approach has undergone a shift from an input-based approach 
to outcome-based empowerment. Saturation of basic necessities has been recognised as 
imperative to achieve this, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives. Government initiatives 
like providing free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under

the Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca 
houses under PM-AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for 
the underprivileged sections.
1.48	 The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last-mile service 
delivery to truly realise the maxim of “no person left behind”. These include the Aspirational 
Districts Programme, launched in 2018, for focusing efforts on the most backward regions, the 
success of which inspired the Aspirational Blocks Programme launched in 2023; the Vibrant 
Villages Programme for border areas; and more recently, the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, 
which saw the participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 202341. The 
digitisation of healthcare, education and governance helps improve the gains for every rupee 
spent. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity 
have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and minimisation of leakages, with ₹36.9 lakh crore 
having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013 (DBT Portal.42).

1.49	 On the employment front, according to the annual PLFS, the all-India annual 
unemployment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining 
since the pandemic. This has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate 
and worker-to-population ratio. Even by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status, 
employment has recovered from the pandemic in urban and rural areas. From the gender 
perspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 
23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 37 per cent in 2022-23, driven mainly by the rising participation of 
rural women.

The monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 increased in real terms 
in both rural and urban areas over 2011-12. The difference between rural and urban MPCE also 
declined in percentage terms.

OUTLOOK
1.52	 The Indian economy recovered swiftly from the pandemic, with its real GDP in FY24 
being 20 per cent higher than the pre-COVID, FY20 levels. This meant a CAGR of 4.6 per cent 
from FY20, despite a 5.8 per cent decline in FY21 inflicted by the pandemic. Analysis in this 
chapter shows that the current GDP level is close to the pre-pandemic trajectory in Q4FY24. 
During the decade ending FY20, India grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, more or 
less reflecting the long-run growth prospects of the economy. This is the background against 
which we can see the prospects for FY25. 
1.53	 IMF projects the global economy to grow at 3.2 per cent in 2024, with risks being broadly 
balanced. The average annual global growth was 3.7 per cent during the decade ending FY20. 
Inflationary pressures have moderated in most economies with declining global commodity 
prices and easing of supply chain pressures. However, core inflation remains sticky and driven 
by high service inflation. Many central banks have hinted at the peaking of the interest rate hike 
cycle. The ECB has already cut the policy rate, while the Fed has hinted at reducing the rate in 
2024. If the services inflation across economies moderates faster, that may allow central banks 
to bring forward the monetary policy easing cycle earlier than currently anticipated. A likely 
reduction in policy rates by central banks of AEs, especially the Fed, will open the space for 
central banks of EMEs to follow the lead, bringing down the cost of capital. 
1.54	 On the downside, any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply 
dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary 
policy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows. This can also influence RBI’s 
monetary policy stance. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise 
trade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. Conversely, 
increased fragmentation along geopolitical lines and renewed thrust on protectionism may 
distort merchandise trade growth, impacting India’s external sector. Global financial markets 
have scaled new heights, with investors betting on global economic expansion. However, any 
corrections in the elevated financial market valuations may have ramifications for household 
finances and corporate valuation, negatively impacting growth prospects. Hiring in the 
information technology sector had slowed down considerably in FY24, and even if hiring does 
not decline further, it is unlikely to pick up significantly. However, leveraging the initiatives 
taken by the government and capturing the untapped potential in emerging markets, exports of 
business, consultancy and IT-enabled services can expand. Despite the core inflation rate being 
around 3 per cent, the RBI, with one eye on the withdrawal of accommodation and another on 
the US Fed, has kept interest rates unchanged for quite some time, and the anticipated easing 
has been delayed.
1.55	 Domestic growth drivers have supported economic growth in FY24 despite uncertain 
global economic performance. Improved balance sheets will help the private sector cater to 
strong investment demand. A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after 
good growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper

imports from countries that have excess capacity. While merchandise exports are likely to 
increase with improving growth prospects in AEs, services exports are also likely to witness 
a further uptick. A normal rainfall forecast by the India Meteorological Department and the 
satisfactory spread of the southwest monsoon thus far are likely to improve agriculture sector 
performance and support the revival of rural demand. However, the monsoon season still has 
some ways to go. Structural reforms such as the GST and the IBC have also matured and are 
delivering envisaged results. Considering these factors, the Survey conservatively projects a 
real GDP growth of 6.5–7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced, cognizant of the fact that the 
market expectations are on the higher side.

CHAPTER
02
MONETARY MANAGEMENT 
AND FINANCIAL 
INTERMEDIATION: 
STABILITY IS THE 
WATCHWORD
India’s banking and financial sectors have displayed a stellar performance in FY24. 
Double-digit and broad-based growth in bank credit, gross and net non-performing 
assets at multi-year lows, and improvement in bank asset quality highlight the 
government’s commitment to a healthy and stable banking sector. Capital markets 
are becoming prominent in India’s growth story, with an expanding share in capital 
formation and investment landscape on the back of technology, innovation, and 
digitisation. Indian stock market was among the best-performing markets, with India’s 
Nifty 50 index ascending by 26.8 per cent during FY24, as against (-)8.2 per cent during 
FY23. The market capitalisation of the Indian stock market has seen a remarkable 
surge, with the market capitalisation to GDP ratio being the fifth largest in the World. 
Supported by regulatory measures and the vision to achieve ‘Insurance for all by 2047’, 
India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets over the next 
five years. The pension sector witnessed a robust increase in subscribers and assets 
under management. 
While the outlook for India’s financial sector appears bright, some areas will require 
focused attention going forward. The significant increase in retail investors in the 
stock market calls for careful consideration. This is crucial because the possibility of 
overconfidence leading to speculation and the expectation of even greater returns, which 
might not align with the real market conditions, is a serious concern. For a developing 
economy such as India, the financial sector needs to support the banking sector and fill 
the gap in capital required for the economy's growth. Therefore, the financial sector 
should expand at a pace that is in lockstep with economic growth. In particular, India 
can ill-afford the economy's over financialisation at its current development stage. 
The increased retail participation in financial markets and familiarity with financial 
products are beginning to grow in line with India’s emergence as the world’s fifth-largest 
economy. Therefore, firms operating in banking, insurance, and capital markets must 
keep the interests of the consumers in mind and improve their service quality through 
fair selling, disclosure, transparency, reliability, and responsiveness. Their internal 
appraisal and incentive systems must be in alignment with these considerations. It is in 
their interest and in the interest of the nation that they optimise their commercial goals 
over the long run. 

Economic Survey 2023-24

INTRODUCTION
2.1	
The Indian economy's financial and banking sectors have shown strong performance 
despite continuous geopolitical challenges. The Central Bank maintained a steady policy rate 
throughout the year, with the overall inflation rate under control. The effects of the monetary 
tightening following the Russia-Ukraine conflict are evident in the lending and deposit interest 
rates increase among banks. Bank loans saw significant and widespread growth across various 
sectors, with personal loans and services leading the way. 
2.2	
Capital markets have also shown impressive results, with India's stock market 
capitalisation to GDP ratio ranking fifth globally.1 The presence of a robust Digital Public 
Infrastructure (DPI) and the greater involvement of banks and microfinance institutions 
(MFIs) have contributed to improved financial inclusion. The insurance and pension sectors 
are also doing well, as indicated by their expanding coverage.
2.3	
Against this backdrop, the chapter is divided into two parts-Monetary developments and 
financial intermediation. The monetary developments part presents the monetary and liquidity 
conditions of the economy. 
2.4	
The financial intermediation part offers a discussion on the state of various financial 
institutions and financial market instruments that form part of the financial market milieu in 
India. Section I of this part presents the performance of the country's banking sector, which 
is the most critical pillar of the financial intermediation landscape. Section II highlights the 
Government’s mechanism for dealing with distressed assets and how the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC/Code) has emerged as a game-changer in resolving insolvencies. 
Section III discusses the Government’s approach towards financial inclusion with increased 
emphasis on digital financial inclusion and data protection. Section IV highlights the role of 
MFIs in facilitating financial inclusion and promoting inclusive growth. Section V discusses the 
securities markets, which have come a long way to become an alternative and efficient means 
of resource mobilisation for the corporate sector and the Government. The global stature of 
India’s securities markets in using technology and best practices in regulations is a matter of 
pride. Section VI concerns the International Financial Services Centre, Gujarat International 
Finance Tec-City (IFSC GIFT City) and how it is emerging as a global financial and IT service 
hub. Sections VII and VIII present the developments in the insurance and pension sectors. 
Section IX discusses the government’s mechanism to ensure regulatory coordination and 
overall financial stability, highlighting the role of the Financial Stability and Development 
Council (FSDC). Section X provides an overall conclusion and the outlook for the financial 
sector while mentioning the key challenges to tackle going forward.

MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
2.5	
Monetary policy plays a crucial role in determining the economic conditions of a country 
through its influence on macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth, inflation, and 
investments. The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while 
keeping in mind the objective of growth. Various instruments of monetary policy, viz. cash 
reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of banks, open market operations of 
the Central Bank, and imposition of credit ceilings, etc., are used by the central bank in the 
direction of this overall objective. This section of the chapter presents the recent monetary 
developments in the economy, focussing on the emerging liquidity conditions and monetary 
policy transmission in terms of lending and deposit rates of banks.
Monetary and Credit Conditions
2.6	
Monetary and credit conditions evolved in line with the monetary policy stance during 
the year, supporting domestic economic activity. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
maintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24. It focused on 
withdrawing accommodation to ensure that inflation gradually aligns with the target while 
supporting growth. With the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points (bps), 
undertaken between May 2022 and February 2023, working its way through the economy, 
the MPC kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February 2023, but with 
readiness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions if the situation so warrants. 
2.7	
Important factors impacting the evolution of monetary and credit conditions during 
FY24 were the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes (May 2023)2, the merger of HDFC, a non-bank 
with HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I-CRR) 
(August 2023). The expansion in reserve money and currency in circulation (CiC) moderated 
due to the return of a predominant part of ₹2,000 banknotes to the banking system as deposits. 
As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the total value of ₹2,000 banknotes in circulation has 
declined from ₹3.56 lakh crore as of 19 May 2023 (when the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes 
was announced) to ₹7,581 crore as of 28 June 2024, indicating that 97.87 per cent of the ₹2,000 
denomination banknotes have returned to the banking system.3 This and an increase in term 
deposit rates contributed to an acceleration in aggregate deposits and broad money (M3). The 
growth in CiC moderated to 4.1 per cent from 7.8 per cent YoY in the last year, reflecting the 
impact of the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes.
2.8	
Reserve Money (M0) recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 6.7 per cent as of 29 March 
2024, compared to 9.7 per cent in the previous year. M0, adjusted for the first-round impact of

2.10	 As of 22 March 2024, the Money Multiplier (MM) was 5.4 against 5.2 a year ago. 
Adjusted for reverse repo amounts, analytically akin to banks’ deposits with the Central Bank, 
the adjusted MM was marginally lower at 5.3 as of March 2024.6 
Liquidity conditions and trends in policy rates
2.11	 The RBI’s liquidity management involved two-way operations in response to shifts in 
liquidity conditions. During FY24, 17 fortnightly Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions 
and seven Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions were undertaken as the primary operation. In 
addition, 49 fine-tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, 
modulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance. Amidst tightened 
liquidity conditions, banks also took recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF). Given 
the extensive deployment of surplus funds under the standing deposit facility (SDF) and 
simultaneous recourse to the MSF, reversal of liquidity facilities under both the SDF and the 
MSF was allowed even during weekends and holidays, effective 30 December 2023.7 
2.12	 Taking cognisance of risks that excess liquidity can pose to price and financial stability 
and the increase in the surplus liquidity, inter-alia, due to the return of ₹2,000 banknotes to 
the banking system, the RBI announced a temporary I-CRR of 10 per cent on 10 August 20238.  
The I-CRR, which impounded about ₹1.1 lakh crore from the banking system, was reviewed 
on 8 September 2023 and discontinued in a phased manner, ending 7 October 2023. The 
impounded amount was thus released to the banking system ahead of the festival season in line 
with the announcement on the Developmental and Regulatory Policies of 10 August 2023. As 
a result of these actions, the banking system's liquidity moderated, becoming a deficit in mid-
September, which persisted during FY24. 
6  Money Multiplier (MM) refers to the amount of M3 a bank generates with each rupee of M0 available to them. It depicts the 
relationship between the monetary base and the economy’s money supply, indicating how fast the money supply will grow from 
the bank’s lending activity. Higher the value of the MM, the higher the liquidity in the market and vice versa.
7  	 This measure will be reviewed after six months or earlier if needed.

Monetary policy transmission
2.13	 Lending and deposit rates of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased further 
during FY24, reflecting the lagged impact of the policy rate hikes during May 2022-February 
2023, the external benchmark-based lending rate system of loan pricing and the moderation 
of surplus liquidity. During the current tightening cycle, i.e., from May 2022 to May 2024, 
the external benchmark-based lending rate and the one-year median marginal-cost-of-funds-
based lending rate increased by 250 bps and 175 bps, respectively. The transmission of hike in 
policy rates to lending and deposit rates is given in Table II.1.

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
2.14	 Financial development and economic growth are inextricably linked, and financial 
intermediation is the pathway through which the former translates into the latter. Financial 
intermediation helps in the efficient allocation of limited resources. Renowned economist Joseph 
Schumpeter believed that the services provided by financial intermediaries, viz. mobilising 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
43
savings, extending credit, storing assets, growing them, managing risk, and facilitating 
transactions, were essential for technological innovation and economic development.9   Financial 
intermediation also facilitates and encourages the inflows of foreign capital. Empirical studies10 
show that efficient and developed financial markets can lead to increased and inclusive economic 
growth by improving the allocation and utilisation of savings and ensuring access to finance to 
all sections of society, including vulnerable groups and small and medium-sized firms. 
2.15	 Financial development parameters should not only be sound, but they also ensure 
the system's financial stability as a whole. This requires indicators such as Capital to Risk 
(Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) , liquid assets to deposits, and short-term credit to be within 
manageable limits. Further, an essential part of financial sector development is implementing 
robust policies for regulation and supervision of all the financial market entities, market players, 
and financial instruments. Coordinating amongst Regulators is paramount in this regard.
Performance of the banking sector and credit availability
2.16	 The soundness and resilience of India’s banking sector have been underpinned by 
ongoing improvements in asset quality, enhanced provisioning for bad loans, sustained capital 
adequacy, and a rise in profitability. Credit growth remains robust, mainly driven by lending 
to services and personal loans. As mentioned in para 2.9-2.10, deposit growth has also gained 
momentum due to the transmission of previous rate increases, resulting in the repricing of 
deposits and higher accretion to term deposits. Lending by non-banking financial companies 
(NBFCs) accelerated, led by personal loans and loans to the industry, and their asset quality has 
improved.

2.17	 Bank credit growth has sustained momentum during FY24, with broad-based growth 
across sectors. Credit disbursal by SCBs stood at ₹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at 
the end of March 2024, compared to 15 per cent growth at the end of March 2023. The trend is 
continuing in FY25, as reflected in a 19 per cent and 19.8 per cent YoY growth in bank credit in 
April and May 2024.
Sectoral credit growth
2.18	 Growth in credit to agriculture and allied activities was in double digits during FY24. 
Agricultural credit had increased nearly 1.5 times from ₹13.3 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹20.7 lakh 
crore in FY24. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has played a pivotal role in providing 
timely and hassle-free credit to farmers, with over 7.4 crore operative KCC accounts at the end 
of 2023.11  Increased credit disbursal to the agricultural sector continued in April and May 2024 
with bank credit to agriculture and allied sectors growing by 19.7 per cent and 21.6 per cent 
YoY, respectively
2.19	 Industrial credit growth picked up in H2 of FY24, registering 8.5 per cent growth in 
March 2024, compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago, driven by an increase in bank credit to small 
and large industries. The boost in credit disbursal to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs) has been supported by the availability of collateral-free loans with a 100 per cent 
credit guarantee under the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). Further, 
the availability of enriched and timely credit data and rapid implementation of digital lending 
infrastructure have significantly contributed towards enhancing lender confidence Box II.1 
discusses the measures undertaken by the Government to ensure credit availability to MSMEs 
and their success. In the future, the development of new technologies, such as the Open Credit 
Enablement Network (OCEN)12, are expected to boost credit flow to the MSME sector. 
Box II.1: Enhancing the flow of bank credit to MSMEs through  formalisation 
Improving credit flow to the MSME sector at low cost has been a policy priority of the 
Government and RBI. Various initiatives have been undertaken in this regard. These are 
elaborated below13:-
●  Introduction of Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS): TReDS 
is a digital platform that facilitates the discounting of MSMEs' trade receivables 
through multiple financiers- Banks and NBFCs- to meet liquidity and working capital 
requirements. Cumulatively, 98.9 lakh invoices amounting to ₹2.9 lakh crore have been 
discounted on TReDS platforms, as of 31 March, 2024 supporting MSMEs for better 
liquidity and working capital management. 
11  	PIB Press Release of Ministry of Finance dated 27 December 2023, https://shorturl.at/EqWwK
12  OCEN is a decentralised open credit network that codifies the flow of credit between borrowers, lenders, and credit distributors 
under a common set of standards. It is expected further to strengthen the digital public infrastructure of the country

●  Change in definition of MSMEs: From 1 July 2020, MSMEs are defined as per a 
composite criterion of turnover and investment in plant and machinery/equipment. 
This is envisaged to bring a large number of entrepreneurs under the ambit of the formal 
banking sector, which will facilitate the flow of credit to the industry at subsidised rates. 
●  Registration of MSMEs on Udyam Portal: The Ministry of MSMEs launched the 
Udyam Registration Portal (URP) on 1 July 2020 and since then has established itself 
as an essential enabler for ease of doing business, as it is free of cost, simple and online. 
This was done to bring entrepreneurs under the ambit of the formal banking sector, 
which will facilitate the flow of credit to MSMEs at subsidised rates. However, one 
challenge with URP is the registration of Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) which are 
sizeable in number. As per the 73rd National Sample Survey, 6.3 crore unincorporated 
non-agricultural entities existed in FY16, primarily micro-enterprises. Since IMEs do 
not have a PAN/GST, they cannot register on URP and avail themselves of the benefits 
of Government programmes. To formalise such enterprises, the Ministry of MSME, 
in collaboration with the Small Industries and Development Bank of India (SIDBI), 
launched the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) on 11 January 2023. Through formalisation, 
informal micro enterprises will be linked to various facilities such as access to markets and 
credit etc. As of June 2024, 1.86 crore IMEs have been onboarded on UAP. More than 
4.5 crore enterprises have been registered on URP and UAP as of 3 June 2024.
●  Revamp of Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) for MSEs: In the Union Budget FY23, 
the revamp of the CGS for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) was announced with a 
required infusion of funds to facilitate an additional credit of ₹2 lakh crore for MSEs. 
Accordingly, the CGS was revamped with an infusion of ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of 
Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. Subsequently, the credit limit under the said 
scheme was enhanced from ₹2 crore to ₹ 5 crore, with a minimum annual guarantee 
fee of as low as 0.37 per cent per annum. Consequently, credit guarantees worth ₹3 lakh 
crore were approved during FY23 and FY24 against the target of ₹2 lakh crore in four 
years. During FY23, out of the guarantees of ₹1.04 lakh crore, ₹16,373 crore and ₹2,750 
crore were extended to women and SC/ST-owned enterprises, respectively. Guarantees 
worth ₹2.02 lakh crore were extended in FY24, out of which ₹32,223 crore and ₹5,393 
crore were extended to women & SC/ST-owned enterprises, respectively. 
To ensure credit availability to IMEs, w.e.f 14 February 2024, the Ministry of MSME made 
a special provision under the existing CGS for MSEs providing that IMEs registered on UAP 
can avail of credit up to ₹20 lakh without primary security and with 85 per cent guarantee 
coverage and a reduced annual guarantee fee. Additionally, initiating legal action is not 
required for financial institutions to invoke the guarantee.

2.20	 Bank credit disbursal to the services sector remained resilient despite a slowdown in 
credit growth to NBFCs. Within the services sector, credit disbursal to the ‘commercial real 
estate’ and ‘trade’ sub-sectors improved in H2 of FY24. Personal loans and NBFCs have the 
largest share of credit disbursed by banks. Within personal loans, housing loan growth remained 
range-bound during FY24, with signs of improvement in April and May 2024.

2.21	 Credit disbursal for housing loans increased from ₹19.9 lakh crore in March 2023 to 
₹27.2 lakh crore in March 2024. Credit growth in personal loans can be attributed to the 
significant digitalisation of the ecosystem with increased use of credit bureaus for faster 
decisions, data collation and validation and e-commerce transactions. However, personal loan 
growth moderated after December 2023 due to increased capital requirements for unsecured 
personal loans, credit cards and lending to NBFCs by the RBI from 100 per cent to 125 per cent.14, 15 
Improvement in asset quality of banks
2.22	 There has been a significant enhancement in the asset quality of banks, led by improved 
borrower selection, more effective debt recovery and heightened debt awareness among large 
borrowers.16 In addition to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, qualitative metrics 
such as enhanced disclosures, robust code of conduct, and transparent governance structures 
have also improved banking performance. 
2.23	 The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, 
reaching a 12-year low of 2.8 per cent at the end of March 2024 from its peak of 11.2 per cent in 
FY18. Lower slippages and a reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgradations

and write-offs led to this decrease. The improvement in SCBs’ asset quality has been broad-
based. The GNPA ratio of the agriculture sector remains high at 6.5 per cent at the end of 
March 2024, but it has recorded persistent improvement during H2 of FY24. The GNPA ratio 
in the personal loans segment improved across all categories. Asset quality improved across all 
significant sub-sectors within the industrial sector, barring vehicles and transport equipment. 
Lower GNPAs and high provisions accumulated in recent years contributed to a decline in net 
NPAs.

2.24	 As SCBs bolstered their capital base by capitalising reserves from higher profits and 
raising fresh capital, their CRAR  increased to 16.8 per cent at the end of March 2024. As of the 
end of March 2024, all banks met this as well as the CET-1 ratio17 requirement of 13.9 per cent, 
well above the regulatory minimum.
2.25	 The net interest margin (NIM) of SCBs remained robust at 3.6 per cent in March 2024. 
With growing net interest income and other operating income  and as the need for additional 
provisions fell, their profit after tax rose by 32.5 per cent (YoY) in March 2024, in spite of a 
large increase in operating expenses. Profitability indicators remained strong, with return on 
equity (RoE) and return on assets (RoA) ratios touching decadal highs in March 2024. Lagged 
effects of transmission of monetary policy rate increases and shifts in liquidity conditions led to 
a 100 basis points increase in the cost of funds as against the 75 basis points rise in the yield on 
assets in FY24. The yield on assets further improved due to the rise in interest rates.
2.26	 It is important to note that in its annual report on ‘Trend and Progress of in Banking in 
India 2021-22’, RBI observed that a high NIM is negatively correlated with financial stability. 
Still, the threshold above which a high NIM is antithetical to financial stability is 5 per cent. The

NIM of SCBs is well below that. It peaked at 3.9 per cent in Q1 of FY24, after which it moderated 
to 3.6 per cent as of March 2024.

2.27	 India’s banking sector has shown remarkable resilience. The macro-and micro-prudential 
measures by RBI and the Government have enhanced risk absorption capacity in recent years, 
improving the banking system's stability. The RBI’s Basic Statistical Returns 2 (Deposits with 
SCBs) reveal that as of March 2024, 56.9 per cent of India’s deposits are with Public Sector 
Banks (PSBs). 61.1 per cent of total deposits are owned by households considered sticky retail 
customers; therefore, deposit withdrawals in this category, in case of an adverse event, are 
likely to remain limited. Second, for the top 10 Indian banks in asset size, loans constitute more 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
49
than 50 per cent of their total assets, making banks immune to the rising interest rate cycle. 
Third, after a phase of recapitalisation and cleaning up of bank balance sheets during the past 
years, there is a visible improvement in various banking indicators. The CRAR for the top 10 
SCB (based on asset size) has been well above Basel III Norms. Fourth, interest rate cycles have 
been quite prominent in India, aligning with RBI's financial conditions and goal to maintain 
economic stability and manage inflationary pressures. The exposure to regular interest rate 
cycles has made Indian banks well-equipped to handle the cycles. 
2.28	 Based on the analysis mentioned above, it is seen that the Indian banking system remains 
sound and resilient, backed by high capital adequacy ratio, improved asset quality and robust 
earnings growth. The trend of improvement in the profitability of SCBs, which began in FY20, 
continued for the fifth consecutive year in FY24. This has been aided by higher income and 
lower provisions and contingencies. 
Dealing with distressed assets
2.29	 The ability to resolve stress in the market is a measure of an economy’s soundness, 
and the ability to do so in the face of an economic slowdown is an essential indicator of the 
economy’s resilience. The last decade saw Indian commercial banks face a crisis due to the 
significant burden of NPA. As of March 2016, the GNPA ratio of the public sector banks was 
14.5 per cent.  The other side of this was the plateauing of the bank debt, which fuelled an 
increase in corporate leverage, leading to the twin-balance sheet problem. Maximum stress was 
in the industry and infrastructure sectors.
2.30	 The Government has paid close attention to resolving stress in banks and corporations 
over the past decade. Measures such as strengthening the banking regulatory framework, 
amending the recovery laws, enacting comprehensive insolvency and bankruptcy legislation, 
and establishing a public sector asset reconstruction company were implemented. These 
measures have nursed the credit sector back to sound health, and the GNPA ratio shrunk to 2.8 
per cent in March 2024. 
2.31	 The emergence of stress in the market due to the operation of market forces and the 
subsequent business/venture failures is a sign of an active and dynamic economy. Since banks 
form the most significant and predominant source of finance for businesses in India, banks 
need to be equipped to deal with the flow of distressed assets, and the markets need to be 
equipped to channel investments into the reconstruction and revival of such assets. 
2.32	 Banking regulations provide for monitoring and timely identification of stressed assets, 
and RBI has taken several measures to strengthen its prudential framework. Regulations also 
provide measures to address stress at its initial stages through restructuring and rescheduling 
loans. The broad contours of these options form a part of banks' risk management tool kit. 
Banking regulations form the first line of defence and measures to address stress. The RBI 
updates them in response to market needs and economic conditions. 

Economic Survey 2023-24

Conventional channels of recovery and reconstruction 
2.33	 The recovery routes viz., Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and the Securitisation and 
Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 
2002, form the second line of measures available to address stress. During FY23, around 45 
per cent of the reduction in GNPAs of SCBs was contributed by recoveries and upgradations.18 
2.34	 The Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)19 regulated under the SARFAESI Act are 
emerging as an alternative channel for investors, including FPIs , to access the NPAs/distressed 
assets held by banks. During FY23, 28 ARCs were operating in the market.20  Such acquisition is 
done by issuing security receipts (SRs), and ARCs are mandated to take at least 15 per cent of the 
SRs issued or 2.5 per cent of the total SRs issued, whichever is higher. The regulatory framework 
has allowed the ARCs to participate as resolution applicants under the IBC process subject to 
certain conditions. It has thereby allowed  harnessing the synergies and complementarities 
of the two market channels of asset reconstruction. During FY23, 9.7 per cent of the previous 
year’s stock of SCBs’ GNPAs was sold to ARCs, compared to only 3.2 per cent in FY22. The 
number of SRs ultimately redeemed increased during FY23, indicating enhanced recovery 
through this mode.
2.35	 The prerequisites for an efficient market for the NPAs are that it should be deep, 
competitive and have adequate liquidity. The market has to have enough investors to ensure 
that the price discovery of the NPAs is efficient. It has to have adequate liquidity to support 
acquisition from the banks and support asset’s turn-around. Apart from direct measures taken 
to reduce the GNPAs, the Government is building systemic strength in the market with market-
based interventions to improve liquidity and competition by establishing a bad bank and 
encouraging the insolvency and bankruptcy ecosystem.    
2.36	 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has implemented several measures 
to improve liquidity in the market for distressed assets. FPIs are permitted to invest in 
debt instruments issued by companies undergoing resolution and in SRs issued by ARCs. 
No minimum investor limit or residual maturity requirement is imposed on FPIs for these 
investments. These measures have led to an increase in FPI investment in SRs issued by ARCs 
from around ₹10,000 crore to ₹14,482 crore during FY2221. SEBI also opened a particular route 
in 2022, the Special Situation Fund, a sub-component of the Alternative Investment Funds, to 
participate in the distressed asset market. It allowed these investment vehicles to invest in SRs 
issued by ARCs and to act as resolution applicants under the IBC process subject to certain 
conditions. With increased access to funds, market participants are likely to invest in more 
NPAs/distressed assets, and the recovery rate for banks is expected to be higher.

Increasing competition in the distressed asset market 
2.37	 To deepen the distressed asset market further, the Government, in July 2021, set up the 
National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. (NARCL) and India Debt Resolution Company 
Ltd. (IDRCL). NARCL acquires assets from banks, and the Government guarantees back the 
SRs issued against these assets. The India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL) has an 
exclusive arrangement with NARCL to resolve assets acquired by the latter. The IDRCL is 
mandated to identify the appropriate resolution strategy for the asset and to aid NARCL in 
optimal resolution outcomes. The assets acquired by the NARCL clear the bank balance sheets 
immediately, freeing capital for further lending.
2.38	 NARCL has so far acquired 18 accounts with loan exposure of around ₹92,000 crore22, 
which includes the acquisition of the ailing Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd and Srei Equipment 
Finance Ltd as resolution applicants. While offers on assets worth ₹1.25 lakh crore are at 
different stages of acquisition, due diligence, and evaluations for assets of around ₹40,000 
crore are underway. The establishment of a government-backed company for the aggregation 
and resolution of distressed assets will further improve liquidity and competition in the market. 
Addressing distressed assets through insolvency resolution 
2.39	 The IBC has been recognised as an effective solution for the twin balance sheet problem, 
where banks are under the stress of NPAs while corporates are overleveraged and unable to 
repay their debt. The Code provides for addressing financial distress early in time. It mandates 
the insolvency professional to conduct the insolvency process and run the operations of the 
distressed corporate debtor. At the same time, the committee of creditors steers the resolution 
process and all significant decisions, thus reducing further erosion of value during the process 
itself. By design and operation, the Code balances the needs of all stakeholders. IBC has provided 
an avenue for corporate debtors to resolve their debt and get an honourable exit from failed 
business endeavours, thus promoting ease of doing business and encouraging entrepreneurship. 
The Code has established itself as an effective solution for addressing banks' stress by aiding 
in significantly reducing GNPAs and helping rescue failing corporate debtors. It has offered 
fresh impetus to the recovery segment of the financial markets and the reconstruction of 
failed/distressed assets in the real sector.  In the eight years since 2016, 31,394 corporate 
debtors involving a value of ₹13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission 
case disposals) as of March 2024. The loss of control immediately after admission into the 
resolution process has led debtors to settle with creditors as soon as the applications are filed 
with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). A singularly notable fact is that ₹10.2 lakh 
crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre-admission stage.23  This change in debtor

behaviour has been a big boon for banks and other lending institutions. The Code has created 
an optimal incentive-disincentive mix to facilitate above-board and transparent dealings in 
creditor-debtor relations.

2.40	 The Code uses the corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) to identify the best 
means to resolve a distressed asset. It has facilitated the successful closure of 4,131 CIRPs until 
March 2024. 3,171 corporate debtors have been rescued, of which 947 cases have been resolved 
through approved resolution plans, which brought in a realisable value of ₹3.36 lakh crore. In the 
resolved cases, the creditors recovered approximately 32 per cent of their claims. This amounted 
to a recovery of 85 per cent of the fair value and 162 per cent of the liquidation value of assets.
2.41	 The impact of IBC on the health of the financial markets is evident as it is the dominant 
recovery route for SCBs  today.24  As per the RBI’s Report on Trends and Progress of Banking 
in India, 2022-23, the IBC held a share of 43 per cent of the total amount recovered by SCBs in 
FY23. In the six years since FY18, the IBC has enabled over ₹3 lakh crore recovery for the SCBs, 
more than what they have recovered through the Lok Adalats, DRTs, and the SARFAESI Act. 
2.42	 More significant to the real sector is that over 3,000 businesses have emerged out of the 
CIRP, with continued business operations extending the productive use of resources trapped 
due to financial distress in these corporate debtors. A study conducted by the Indian Institute 
of Management, Ahmedabad, reports25  that the resolved firms that went through the resolution 
process under the Code have witnessed a significant improvement in their performance in 
24 	It is important to note that the foremost objective of the Code is resolution of stressed corporate debtors. Recovery of claims is 
only incidental to the process of resolution.

terms of increase in tangible assets and average capex in the post-resolution period compared 
to the pre-resolution period, the aggregate market valuation of resolved firms rose from around 
₹2 lakh crore in the pre-resolution phase to ₹6 lakh crore in the post-resolution phase. There 
is a substantial increase in total employment and around a 50 per cent increase in the average 
employee expenses in the resolved firms (listed) in the three years post-resolution. It is hard to 
find another policy measure that has created winners.
2.43	 As of March 2024, the total CIRPs ending in liquidation were 2,476. Around 77 per cent 
of these corporate debtors were defunct at the beginning of the process and were, on average, 
valued at 7 per cent of the outstanding debt.  The liquidation process provides a last window of 
opportunity for the revival of the asset through a going concern Sale/Compromise/Arrangement 
to maximise the value rescued. Around 50 businesses have been rescued at this last resort. 586 
firms were dissolved at the end of the liquidation process, releasing whatever resources were 
needed for alternate uses. 
2.44	 Nine of the twelve large accounts26 referred by the RBI for resolution under the IBC 
have been resolved. The resolution plans for these corporate debtors yielded 54 per cent of the 
claims admitted. These debtors included steel and power majors such as Electrosteel Steels 
Ltd., Bhushan Steel Ltd., Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd., Essar Steel India Ltd., Bhushan Power 
& Steel Ltd., etc., and their resolutions played a significant role in the revival of the steel sector.  
The framework under Section 227 of the IBC provides for the resolution of financial service 
providers, and, at present, NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies with asset size of ₹500 
crore or more, are covered. The framework has enabled the resolution of Dewan Housing Finance 
Corporation Ltd., Srei Equipment Finance Limited and Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited under 
this framework. In each case, the creditors have recovered around 42 per cent of the claims. 
Box II.2 discusses the role of the IBC process in resolving financial stress of real estate companies.
Box II.2: Role of IBC in reviving stalled real estate projects and strengthening 
homebuyers’ rights
Before 2016, the only remedy available for homebuyers whose housing projects were stalled 
for various reasons was through the Consumer Forums established under the Consumer 
Protection Act of 1986. In FY24, over 5,50027 cases were filed with the National Consumer 
Dispute Redressal Commission, and almost 21 per cent were related to the housing sector.  
However, the number of cases resolved through the consumer redressal route has been 
minimal. It was estimated that 4.1 lakh dwelling units in real estate projects across the 
country involving ₹4.1 lakh crore were under stress.28

The year 2016 saw the enactment of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 
2016 (RERA Act). This provided a dedicated grievance redressal mechanism to the 
aggrieved homebuyers and a means to rein in errant real estate contractors and companies. 
Subsequent enactment of the IBC in the same year opened another channel and has been the 
most favoured among the three available remedies. As of March 2024, over 1500 real estate 
companies were admitted into the insolvency resolution process under the IBC, accounting 
for 21 per cent of total admissions. One in four cases settled after admission was also from 
this sector. Of the 891 corporate debtors resolved, 133 were real estate companies, forming 
15 per cent of the companies resolved.
Insolvency resolution of real estate companies posed a unique set of challenges for the 
standardised corporate insolvency process. Real estate companies have multiple projects 
spread across geographies, projects at different stages of construction, and diversified 
business models. The large number of homebuyers across these projects meant claims from 
thousands of homebuyers who needed to be included in the process. The judiciary, the 
Government, and the market have recognised these difficulties and moved in cohesive steps 
to improve outcomes for these projects. The availability of two new remedial routes led to 
discord and friction in the system.
The Insolvency Law Committee, in its March 201829  report took cognisance of the peculiarity 
of the real estate sector. It recommended that the amount raised from homebuyers be 
considered financial debt as it formed a significant contribution to finances raised and had 
the commercial effect of borrowing. This led to substantial changes in the CIRP by making 
homebuyers a distinguished class of creditors and a part of the Committee of Creditors, 
enabling their direct participation in decision-making. A system to organise and derive 
decisions, through consensus of majority voting of the thousands of homebuyers, was also 
worked out to introduce insolvency professionals as authorised representatives. Further 
amendments enabled insolvency to be initiated by a joint application of not less than 100 
allottees or not less than 10 per cent of the total number of allottees under the same project, 
ensuring that frivolous applications are not filed. As clarity emerged on the use of IBC as a 
remedy for homebuyers, it was also laid out that resolution plans approved for real estate 
projects should necessarily be compliant with the RERA Act, thereby restoring primacy to 
the sectoral law and the sectoral regulator in its domain for optimal oversight of the sector.
By way of innovation in economic law, the judiciary paved the way for solutions in resolving 
real estate corporate debtors. As a class of creditors, it enabled homebuyers to act as resolution 
applicants. It approved what was termed a “reverse CIRP”, where the corporate debtor could 
take measures to complete the project even as the resolution process was underway. The 
judiciary has allowed project-specific resolution plans, targeting the affected project alone 
under the same corporate debtor. This measure relieved the corporate debtors and allottees 
of different projects, and the market has responded positively.

Several real estate companies have successfully resolved and enabled the progress of stalled 
projects. In the case of Value Infracon India Private Limited, the resolution process yielded 
creditors 98 per cent of the claim value and 189 per cent of the asset’s liquidation value.
In the cases of Ashiana Landcraft Realty Private Limited and Anudan Properties Private 
Limited, the resolutions yielded around 2.5 times the liquidation value of the assets. Large 
corporate debtors in the sector, like Jaypee Infratech Limited, have been resolved with a 
recovery of 88 per cent for creditors, and assets have been acquired at over 114 per cent of 
liquidation value.30 
Even as the pace of resolutions picked up under the IBC, there was still a need to channel/
redirect investments into these stressed projects. To address this vital gap, the Government 
set up the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) with a target 
corpus of ₹12,500 crore in 2019. It is a professionally managed Alternative Investment 
Fund (AIF) aimed at providing priority debt financing for the completion of stalled housing 
projects, including corporate debtors and projects undergoing the resolution process under 
the Code. As of April 2024, the SWAMIH Fund has delivered 32,000+ homes and the 
delivery of 20,000 homes every year for the next three years is being targeted.
The impact of seamless resolutions and progress of cases under IBC and improvement 
in liquidity through the AIF is reflected in the healthy balance sheets of banks, thereby 
enhancing their ability to lend further.
2.45	 The Government has taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem. It has 
strengthened the NCLT regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and 
proposing an integrated IT platform. The regulations have been amended to keep in line with 
the needs of the markets and the advances in judicial pronouncements. The IBC has established 
itself as an indispensable component of the asset recovery and reconstruction market. In the 
process, it has forever changed the credit market landscape in the country for good.
Financial inclusion is within reach; digital financial inclusion is the 
next goal
2.46	 Financial inclusion is not just a goal but also a means to an end as an enabler for sustainable 
economic growth, reduction of inequality and elimination of poverty. The United Nations (UN) 
has positioned financial inclusion as a prominent enabler of other development goals in the 
2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Academic evidence states that financial inclusion 
can enhance overall economic growth and facilitate the achievement of different SDGs.
2.47	 The Government has prioritised delivering financial services to the last mile. Given 
the low levels of financial inclusion and formal identification in 2008, the magnitude of the 
challenges facing India a little over a decade ago was immense. According to the World Bank’s 
Global Financial Inclusion Database, India has made remarkable progress in its financial 
inclusion goals over the past ten years. The number of adults with an account in a formal 
financial institution increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 77 per cent in 2021.  There has been 
30 	As per data as reflected in the summary of outcomes released by IBBI, https://ibbi.gov.in/en/claims/cd-summary

Economic Survey 2023-24

an increase in the percentage of adults saving in a financial institution and borrowing from 
formal sources. There is a decline in the access gap between the rich and the poor. Further, 
the gender divide in terms of financial inclusion has also narrowed. While progress has been 
made on gender in financial inclusion, India’s youth are seeing the same benefits (Table II.2). 
Compared to South Asian and world averages, it is seen that India’s performance is better in 
specific indicators (Table II.3). 
2.48	 Based on the bank account data and the relationship with GDP per capita, one rough 
estimate is that it would have taken 47 years to achieve 80 per cent of adults with a bank account 
had India solely relied on traditional growth processes.31

by enhancing direct benefit transfer (DBT) flows through these accounts, promoting digital 
payments using RuPay cards, UPI etc. The RBI launched UPI123Pay in March 2022 as an option 
to make UPI payments for feature phones, and the National Payments Corporation of India 
(NPCI) introduced UPI Lite, an on-device wallet service provided by select banks that allows 
low-value transactions up to ₹200 through the BHIM app. These innovations are steps towards 
accelerating the digital adoption process in India by creating a more prosperous and inclusive 
ecosystem that can accommodate larger sections of the population. India is also collaborating 
with several countries to bring more efficiency to national and cross-border payment systems. 
2.50	 RBI has been collaborating bilaterally with various countries to link India’s Fast 
Payments System (FPS), i.e., UPI, with their respective FPSs for cross-border Person to Person 
(P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) payments. The RBI joined Project Nexus, a multilateral 
international initiative to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic 
FPSs. The Nexus aims to connect the FPSs of four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, 
Singapore, and Thailand) and India, who would be the founding members and first mover 
countries of this platform. An agreement to this effect was signed by the BIS and the central 
banks of the founding countries on 30 June 2024.32  The platform is expected to go live by 2026. 
Once functional, Nexus is expected to play an important role in making retail cross-border 
payments efficient, faster, and more cost-effective. 
2.51	 The main components of the RBI’s strategy for financial inclusion have been a target-based 
approach, market development, strengthening infrastructure, innovation, and technology, 
last-mile delivery, consumer protection and financial literacy and awareness.33 Following this 
strategy, the progress on financial inclusion so far is presented below:

33 	The RBI launched a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-2024, with the vision to help expand and sustain the 
financial inclusion process at the national level through a broad convergence of actions involving all the stakeholders in the 
financial sector. The strategy aimed to provide affordable access to formal financial services, broaden and deepen financial 
inclusion, and promote financial literacy and consumer protection.

Digital Financial Inclusion
2.52	 A key enabler of this financial inclusion drive has been the digitalisation of the financial 
system, which has catalysed the transformation of the financial services landscape worldwide. 
With financial services now available on tap on digital devices, the next big challenge is to 
ensure ‘Digital financial inclusion (DFI).’ DFI involves arranging cost-effective digital means to 
reach currently financially excluded and underserved citizens with a range of formal financial 
services suited to their needs. The essential components of DFI include the availability of digital 
transactional platforms to enable customers to make or receive payments and devices to enable 
such transactions. These retail agents have digital devices and additional financial services via 
a digital transactional platform. 
2.53	 While measures were afoot towards digitisation of financial services in India, the 
COVID-19 pandemic gave further momentum to the process when the most vulnerable and 
excluded citizens were severely affected. The Government, accordingly, encouraged innovation 
and developed a well-stacked digital infrastructure and technology-led system. This has evolved 
into an inclusive, cost-efficient, and responsible DPI. 
2.54	 With the objective of India emerging as a fintech nation, the Government has launched 
many flagship schemes such as the Digital India Mission, Make-in-India, etc. Greater emphasis 
has been given to the creation of DPI such as Aadhaar, e-KYC, Aadhaar-enabled Payment 
System, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e-sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital 
Commerce, etc. These DPIs can be utilised on a shared basis by different players to ensure 
optimum outcomes. Their usage has brought transparency, scale operation and timely delivery 
of financial services to the public.
2.55	 India's robust DPI has played a pivotal role in enabling the country's digital transformation, 
providing citizen-centric and transparent governance services. India’s fast-growing population, 
world-class DPI, and proactive regulations have underpinned the Fintech industry's growth. 
India is among the fastest-growing fintech markets in the World, hailing as the third-largest 
growing fintech economy.

2.56	 Advances in DFI have enabled millions of people in the formal and vast informal economy 
to accept payments, settle invoices, and transfer funds anywhere in the country with just a 
few screen taps. These advances are built on the India Stack, a comprehensive digital identity, 
payment, and data-management system. India Stack consists of three interconnected layers that 
provide a digital identity to every Indian while facilitating easy, cost-free, mobile-first digital 
transactions. The three critical components of India Stack34 are the Identity Layer, payment 
layer and data governance layer. Regarding the identity layer, Aadhaar has been instrumental 
in transforming India's authentication ecosystem. It has facilitated the KYC process, reducing 
the cost of conducting e-KYC from USD 12 to 6 cents, extending banking to millions of Indians 
and improving financial inclusion. In the case of the payment layer, the UPI has revolutionised 
the country's payment system. The success of UPI has been enhanced by the expansion of 
smartphone usage in India, with more than 116.5 crore smartphone subscribers as of 31 March 
2024.35  The value of transactions conducted on the UPI platform has increased multifold from 
₹0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to ₹200 lakh crore in FY24.36 The data governance layer focuses on 
ensuring ownership and control over the user data to its rightful owners.
2.57	 Digital credit can be a powerful agent for sustainable and inclusive growth by empowering 
individuals and firms to cultivate economic opportunities. According to the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) research, an increase in digital financial inclusion in payments leads to 
a 2.2 per cent rise in average economic growth, likely driven through the consumption channel 
and higher formalisation.37  
Microfinance institutions: facilitating financial inclusion
‘Access to formal finance can boost job creation, reduce vulnerability to economic shocks and 
increase investment in human capital. With adequate access to financial services, individuals 
and firms can rely on costly informal sources of finance to meet their financial needs and 
pursue growth opportunities. At a macro level, greater financial inclusion can support 
sustainable and inclusive socio-economic growth for all.’
- National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-24, RBI
2.58	 Microfinance refers to providing financial services, including small-value loans to 
households, small businesses and entrepreneurs who lack access to formal banking services. It 
is an effective tool for financial inclusion, which involves sustainably providing microfinance 
and related services to enable the poor and the marginalised to achieve social equity and 
empowerment. Microfinance has been playing an essential role in meeting low-income 
households' credit needs by providing affordable doorstep services. They have also played a

role in extending other financial services like insurance, remittance, financial literacy, etc. 
Microfinance has emerged as one of the most important tools for fostering financial inclusion. 
2.59	 The evolution of the MFI sector in India has been substantially facilitated by the 
supportive regulatory framework of RBI coupled with the formulation of an Industry Code of 
Conduct by the Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), such as Sa-Dhan38  and MFIN.39  The 
New Regulatory Framework for Microfinance Loans issued by the RBI for the microfinance 
sector on 14 March 2022 ensures that all entities operating in the microfinance space are 
subject to the same regulations, creates a level playing field and safeguards the interest of the 
borrowers. 
2.60	 Globally, the Indian microfinance sector is the second largest after China in terms of 
number of borrowing customers in India, which are about three times that of the next biggest 
market, i.e., Indonesia. The Indian microfinance coverage (Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Joint 
Liability Group (JLG)) is more than 50 per cent of households and 10 per cent of the Indian 
population.40

646 plus districts in India. Two hundred and thirteen MFIs operate in India as of FY23, with 
a branch network of 25,790, engaging 2.2 lakh employees. Together, they have reached out to 
over 532 lakh clients with a total loan outstanding of ₹1.8 lakh crore under micro-credit.41  The 
addition of new clients reflects the continuing inclusion efforts of the sector and offers hope 
for the remoter and underserved geographies. As of 31 March 2023, the number of clients with

loans outstanding with MFIs, including those overdue over 179 days, was 571 lakhs. Out of 
these, the active clients (excluding the clients having overdue over 179 days) served by MFIs 
stood at 532 lakhs, posting a YoY growth of 19 per cent. 
2.62	 Though MFIs serve both rural and urban poor, they are oriented more towards rural areas 
in India. Urban borrowers dominated for a while.There is a definite shift thereafter towards the 
rural sector, and it has continued for the last four years. The present share of the rural clientele 
is at 74 per cent.

the total clients of MFIs. Further, it also serves other weaker and marginalised sections like 
scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST) and minorities in a significant way. The SC/ST 
borrowers constitute a substantial 23 per cent of the clients.

2.64	 Disbursement of loans by MFIs recorded steady growth throughout, except in some years 
due to external events like the COVID-19 pandemic, etc. During FY23, the microfinance sector 
bounced back strongly, achieving an aggregate disbursement of ₹1.8 lakh crore, 55 per cent 
higher than the previous year. 
2.65	 The performance and profitability ratios of MFIs during FY23 provide a picture of good 
health and improving prospects of the industry. The industry managed to trim operating costs 
while retaining finance costs at more or less the same level as in previous years. The total assets 
of the MFIs stood at ₹1.5 lakh crore at the end of FY23, 30 per cent higher than the previous 
year. The sector has been going from strength to strength for the last few years, except for one 
or two years in between owing to some external events. In FY23, RoA and RoE stood at 2.5 
per cent and 12.2 per cent for all MFIs, reflecting an improvement over the previous year. As 
per the RBI regulatory norms, NBFC-MFIs need to maintain at least 15 per cent of their risk-
weighted assets in the form of capital. The capital adequacy of Indian MFIs is largely well above 
the prescribed norms, with the median CAR for FY23 at 26.5 per cent.
2.66	 During FY23, good progress in enhancing portfolio quality has been achieved by the 
MFIs, as they have been able to rein in defaults, improve recoveries, and deal with chronic 
cases through settlements and write-offs. The Performance and Accountability Reporting 
(PAR) 30+ ratios for MFIs are moving towards pre-COVID levels but are still short of the lowest 
delinquency ratios achieved in FY19. The CRIF-Highmark analysis shows that, during FY23, 
MFIs were able to reduce forward flows of impaired loans42 from one bucket to the next in 
the case of 30, 60, and 90-day PAR. However, the forward flows in the 91 to 180-day buckets 
increased for MFIs and banks.43  
2.67	 The success of the microfinance sector in rural India can be measured using several 
indicators. The most extensive microfinance programme, the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme 
(SHG-BLP), has captured the post-pandemic recovery through the number and amount of SHGs 
with loans outstanding with banks over FY22 and FY23. During FY23, the credit disbursement 
under SHG-BLP was ₹1.5 lakh crore, registering a growth of 45.6 per cent. The number of 
SHGs credit linked during FY23 increased to 43 lakh from 34 lakh in FY22. As of March 2023, 
the banking system held SHG savings to the tune of ₹58,893 crore with a growth of 24.7 per 
cent, with average savings per SHG amounting to ₹43,940.44  The improvement in the RBI’s 
Financial Inclusion Index from 60.1 in March 2023 to 64.2 in March 2024 indicates the strides 
being made in the area of access, usage, and quality of the financial sector in India.45

Trends in indian capital markets 
2.68	 Despite heightened geopolitical risks, rising interest rates and volatile commodity prices, 
Indian capital markets have been one of the best performing among emerging markets in FY24, 
reflecting India’s bright economic stature. Capital markets are becoming prominent in India’s 
growth story, with an expanding share in capital formation and investment landscape on the 
back of technology, innovation, and digitisation. The following sections present the significant 
trends in primary markets, secondary markets, and institutional investment in India.
Primary Markets
2.69	 Amid healthy domestic economic performance and a favourable investment climate, 
primary markets remained robust during FY24, facilitating capital formation of ₹10.9 lakh 
crore (which approximates 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public 
corporates during FY23), compared to ₹9.3 lakh crore in FY23. Of the total amount mobilised 
in FY24, 78.8 per cent was raised through debt issuances. Fund mobilisation through all three 
modes, viz., equity, debt, and hybrid, increased by 24.9 per cent, 12.1 per cent and 513.6 per 
cent, respectively, in FY24 compared to the previous year. 
2.70	 The number of initial public offers (IPOs) increased by 66 per cent in FY24 from 164 in 
FY23 to 272 in FY24, while the amount raised grew by 24 per cent (from ₹54,773 crore in FY23 
to ₹67,995 crore in FY24). SME platforms at the exchanges witnessed heightened activities 
during FY24 as the number of IPOs/FPOs (Follow-on Public Offers) of SMEs increased by 1.6 
times (from 125 in FY23 to 196 in FY24), while the corresponding fund raised rose by more 
than two and half times over the previous year (from ₹2,333 crore in FY23 to ₹6,095 crore 
in FY24). As per E&Y Global IPO trends report, Indian exchanges were global leaders in IPO 
listings. India’s share consistently rose to 17 per cent in 2023 from 6 per cent and 11 per cent in 
2021 and 2022, respectively.46 Reflecting the buoyant market conditions, Qualified Institutional 
Placements (QIPs)47 emerged as a critical equity fundraising mechanism for the corporates 
during FY24. Resource mobilisation through rights issues more than doubled to ₹15,110 crore 
during FY24, compared to ₹6,751 crore in the previous year.
Public debt issuances
2.71	 The corporate debt market in India is going from strength to strength. During FY24, the 
value of corporate bond issuances increased to ₹8.6 lakh crore from ₹7.6 lakh crore during the 
previous financial year. The number of corporate bonds public issues in FY24 was the highest 
for any financial year so far, with the amount raised (₹19,167 crore) at a four-year high. Private 
placements remained the preferred channel for corporates, accounting for 97.8 per cent of 
total resources mobilised through the bond market. Increasing investor demand and the rise in

47 	QIP was introduced by SEBI in 2006, under which Indian listed companies can raise funds by issuing equity shares, fully or 
partially convertible debentures, or any other securities as mentioned under the notification by SEBI in this regard. Listed 
companies can raise capital without meeting the legal requirements like submitting the pre-issue filings to SEBI.

the cost of borrowing from banks have made these markets more attractive for corporates for 
funding requirements. The quantum of outstanding corporate bonds increased by 5.5 per cent 
YoY to ₹45 lakh crore (i.e., 15.5 per cent of GDP) at the end of March 2024. 
REITs and InvITs
2.72	 During FY24, ₹39,024 crore was raised by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and 
Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), more than five times compared to FY23, supported 
by the Government's thrust on infrastructure development. 
Secondary Markets
India among the best-performing markets
2.73	 After enduring a highly turbulent global environment in FY23, global stock markets 
recovered and performed well during FY24. All the major markets, except China and Hong 
Kong, delivered better returns during the period compared to the previous year. Indian stock 
market was among the best-performing markets, with India’s Nifty 50 index ascending by 26.8 
per cent during FY24, as against (-)8.2 per cent during FY23. FY24 saw stellar performances 
from the US, Brazilian and Japanese markets among the global markets. There was evidence of 
an AI-led tech stock surge, with the tech-heavy US Nasdaq index rising by 34 per cent during 
FY24 after delivering heavy losses in FY23.

2.74	 The exemplary performance of the Indian stock market compared to the world and 
emerging markets over the years can be primarily attributed to India’s resilience to global 
geo-political and economic shocks, its solid and stable domestic macroeconomic outlook, and 
the strength of the domestic investor base. Mirroring the positive outlook on Indian markets, 
India’s weight in the MSCI-EM index has increased to 17.7 per cent at the end of FY24 from 13.7 
per cent at the end of April 23, the second-highest share among the EMs in the index.

2.75	 The market capitalisation of the Indian stock market has seen a remarkable surge over 
the years. Significant interest from domestic and global investors in the Indian stock market as 
an attractive investment destination and sustained IPO activity placed the Indian market fifth 
in the world by market capitalisation in FY24. India’s market capitalisation to GDP ratio has 
improved significantly over the last five years to 124 per cent in FY24, compared to 77 per cent 
in FY19, far higher than that of other emerging market economies like China and Brazil. It is 
essential to strike a note of caution. The market capitalisation to GDP ratio is not necessarily a 
sign of economic advancement or sophistication. Financial assets are claims on real goods and 
services. If equity market claims on the real economy are excessively high, it is a harbinger of 
market instability rather than market resilience.
2.76	 The value traded increased across all segments in the exchanges, except currency 
derivatives during FY24, with increased investors' participation and positive market trends. 
Commodity derivatives turnover rose by 87 per cent in FY24, driven by an increase in turnover 
of options contracts of the energy segment.

2.77	 Box II.3 discusses the initiatives undertaken to strengthen the capital markets through 
the use of technology, which have played a significant role in enhancing their performance and 
efficiency.
Box II.3: The synergy of technology and Indian capital markets: Driving 
growth and efficiency
Indian capital markets have witnessed a broad-based expansion across various sub-markets, 
with the country's equity market capitalisation reaching ₹415 lakh crore (USD 5 trillion) in 
May 2024, placing it fifth in the global rankings.
The proliferation of technology has been a critical catalyst in transforming economies 
worldwide, and the Indian capital markets have been no exception. The sector has 
continuously transformed over the past few years, leveraging technological advancements 
to facilitate growth and efficiency.

Economic Survey 2023-24
66
Technology plays a role in meeting the market regulator SEBI's three goals: market 
regulation, investor protection, and market development. 
Individual investors today are over 9.5 crore and have nearly 10 per cent direct ownership 
of the market through its almost 2500 listed companies. This translates to around ₹36 lakh 
crore of wealth as of March 2024, apart from indirect ownership in equity mutual funds 
that have ₹28 lakh crore in assets under management (AuM). In this manner, technology 
allows exchanges to help allocate capital to firms and millions of market investors to invest 
in companies they have never visited and participate in their long-term success and wealth 
creation. Overall, the market capitalisation in India has risen by over 100 times in the last 
three decades.
Technological advancements such as India Stack and regulatory measures have fuelled 
an unprecedented surge in retail investor participation and activity. The prevalence and 
proliferation of user-friendly trading apps, mobile-friendly educational resources, and
financial market guidance have democratised access to the capital markets.48 The seamless 
use of technology has empowered investors to open trading and demat accounts online 
within minutes, trade from the comfort of their homes, access investment reports, and 
raise queries online efficiently. Initiatives such as the SEBI Complaints Redress System 
(SCORES), a platform for investor grievance resolution, and Securities Market Trainers 
(SMARTs) a program for investor education, have been instrumental in safeguarding the 
interests of market participants, particularly first-time investors. 
Technology has also played a crucial role in market development. India's unique digital 
architecture has imbued the capital market regulator with the confidence to switch to the 
"T+1 settlement regime” comfortably, a feat followed by very few countries worldwide.49 
The introduction of “Interoperability” among clearing corporations (CCs) created a one-
to-many relationship between stock exchanges and CCs that reduced trading costs via 
better margin utilisation and capital resources of the participants.50 Indian capital markets 
have also adopted on a pilot basis the “Application Supported by Blocked Account” facility 
in the secondary market, which allows investors to block funds in their bank until trade 
confirmation. A recent initiative of the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) titled 
NSDL-CAS has further eased the investors' lives by presenting an aggregated view of assets 
held in demat format across multiple accounts and mutual fund folios.51 
Beyond growth, investor safety, and market development, business continuity today has 
become a critical aspect of capital markets. Initiated in 2022, the “Disaster Recovery (DR)

49 Indian equity markets have even transitioned to same-day settlement cycles ("T+0") in a limited manner, becoming the first 
nation to do so. The transition to shorter settlement cycles has increased efficiency and reduced settlement risk.

45” framework allows the continuation of trading using existing connectivity parameters in 
case of unforeseen events with minimal switching time.52 In consultation with SEBI, stock 
exchanges and brokers have implemented various measures to address technical glitches in 
stockbrokers' electronic trading systems, such as the "LAMA (Log Analytics and Monitoring 
Application) reporting" API, a monitoring platform to overview the IT structure and perform 
analytics thereof.53 Additionally, clearing corporations like NSCCL and ICCL54 have worked 
on two-way portability to be operated as a "SaaS" (Software as a Service) model to manage 
unforeseen software failures.55 
While the synergy of technology and capital markets has unlocked significant benefits, 
evolving challenges must be addressed. Privacy concerns, cybersecurity risks, and the 
rising digital divide in the population are some issues that require attention. Nonetheless, 
regulators have been steadfast in their approach, realising that unlocking the maximum 
potential from the marriage of technology and capital markets is essential for the overall 
growth and development of the Indian economy.
Retail Participation in the Capital Market
2.78	 The Indian capital markets have seen a surge in retail activity through direct (trading in 
markets through their accounts) and indirect (through mutual funds) channels in the last few 
years. The individual investor's share in the equity cash segment turnover was at 35.9 per cent 
in FY24. The number of demat accounts with both depositories rose from 1,145 lakh in FY23 
to 1,514 lakh in FY24. The impact of this influx of individual investors in the market is also 
reflected in new investor registrations with the exchanges, their share in total traded value, 
net investments, and ownership in the listed companies. For instance, the registered investor 
base at NSE has nearly tripled from March 2020 to March 2024 to 9.2 crore as of 31 March 
2024, potentially translating into 20 per cent of the Indian households now channelling their 
household savings into financial markets. 
Mutual Funds (MFs): Accelerating the financial savings and retail participation in capital 
markets
2.79	 A rise in retail participation was more substantial and steadier through the indirect 
channel via mutual funds. FY24 has been a spectacular year for MFs as their AuM of the MFs 
increased by ₹14 lakh crore (YoY growth of 35 per cent) to ₹53.4 lakh crore at the end of FY24, 
boosted by mark-to-market (MTM) gains and expansion of the industry. The total number of 
folios increased from 14.6 crore at the end of FY23 to 17.8 crore at the end of FY24. Barring 
income/debt-oriented schemes, all categories of MF schemes witnessed net inflows. Inflows 
into growth/equity-oriented and hybrid schemes accounted for more than 90 per cent of net

inflows into MFs. Among the passive schemes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) (other than gold 
exchange-traded funds) witnessed a 37 per cent rise in net assets in FY24.
2.80	 The MF segment presently has about 8.4 crore systematic investment plan (SIP) accounts56 
through which investors regularly invest in schemes. Annual net SIP flows have doubled in the 
last three years, from ₹0.96 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹2 lakh crore in FY24. Total SIP AuM is 
approximately 35 per cent of the AuM of the MF industry for equity-oriented schemes. This 
has pushed up ownership of MFs in Indian equities to 9.2 per cent as of 31 December 2023, 
compared to 7.7 per cent as of 31 December 2021.

2.81	 Some of the factors that facilitated the entry of investors in the pandemic period and 
beyond included seamless technological integration, Government measures towards financial 
inclusion, growth of digital infrastructure, rapid smartphone penetration, a rise of low-cost 
brokerages, the pursuit of generating income from alternative sources and lower returns 
generated by traditional asset classes such as real estate and gold. However, retail investors have 
cashed in their gains in financial markets and been investing in real assets. It is smart portfolio 
diversification. A conducive economic environment in the form of lower interest rates, sustained 
post-COVID-19 recovery, elevated inflation, and a supportive policy backdrop also boosted the 
retail accumulation of capital market assets. Further, continuous investor awareness programs 
focusing on the rights and responsibilities of investors have contributed to the continuing 
growth of individual participation in securities markets. In August 2023, SEBI introduced 
the Online Dispute Resolution, which combines online conciliation and online arbitration to 
resolve disputes arising in the securities market. Another significant measure introduced in 
FY24 was the centralised mechanism for reporting and verification in case of demise of an 
investor, thereby smoothening the transmission process to the legal heirs. Enhanced Investor 
56 A SIP is a systematic approach to investing in mutual funds that involves allocating a small pre-determined amount of money 
for investment in the market at regular intervals.

Protection Fund57 and Settlement Guarantee Fund58 and shortening of the settlement cycle 
have improved the perception of safety and security in the Indian markets. Nonetheless, it is 
essential to ensure that retail investors do not mistake these funds as mechanisms to underwrite 
their losses and provide a backstop.
2.82	 The number of unique tax IDs registered on the NSE rose from 2.7 crore in FY19 to 9.2 
crore in FY24. The enhanced participation of retail investors in the Indian capital market is 
hugely welcome and lends stability to the capital market. It has also enabled retail investors 
to earn higher returns on their savings. Most of the new retail investors are likely young and 
may have a higher risk appetite. It is also reflected in the interest that retail investors have 
shown in derivatives trading, especially expiration-day trading. While derivatives are hedging 
instruments, they are mostly used as speculative instruments by investors worldwide. India is 
likely no exception. 
2.83	 Derivatives trading holds the potential for outsized gains. Thus, it caters to humans' 
gambling instincts and can augment income if profitable. These considerations are likely 
driving active retail participation in derivatives trading. However, globally, derivatives trading 
loses money for the investors, for the most part. Raising investor awareness and continuous 
financial education is essential to warn them of the low or negative expected returns from 
derivatives trading. A significant stock correction could see losses that are more considerable 
for retail investors participating in capital markets through derivatives. Investors’ behavioural 
response would be to feel ‘cheated’ by unseen more considerable forces. They may not return to 
capital markets for a long time. That is a loss to them and the economy.
2.84	 The financialisation of economies has not ended well, even for advanced economies. The 
global financial crisis of 2008 is an obvious example. Developing countries face debilitating 
crises when financial market ‘innovations’ and growth run ahead of economic growth. The Asian 
crisis of 1997-98 set back the high-flying economies of the region for a long time. Therefore, 
India needs to have an orderly and gradual evolution of the financial market.59
2.85	 All stakeholders – market participants, market infrastructure institutions, regulators, 
and the Government must ensure that capital markets play their theoretically assigned role of 
directing savings to their most productive investments. It is not just in the national interest. It 
is an act of self-interest, too.
Social Stock Exchanges: Leveraging finance from a social stand-point
2.86	 Box II.4 discusses the role of the Social Stock Exchange (SSE) in bridging the financing 
gap by providing alternative fund-raising instruments for achieving socio-development goals. 
57 	The Investor Protection Fund compensates the investors to the extent of funds found insufficient in the defaulters' account to 
meet the admitted value of the claim, subject to a maximum limit of ₹25 lakh per investor per defaulter/expelled member in 
respect of claims arising on expulsion/declaration of default of members.
58 	The objective of the Settlement Guarantee Fund is to guarantee the settlement of all transactions of the members of the 
exchange inter-se through the stock exchange.

Box II.4: Social Stock Exchanges in India: Making progress
Indian securities markets, over the years, have been characterised by momentous strides 
in expanding the retail footprint in finance, innovative fund-raising, and regulatory solid 
scrutiny of stock exchange platforms. To leverage this transparency and rigour of equity 
markets for social good, in the Union Budget of FY20, the Government proposed to initiate 
steps towards creating a SSE under the regulatory ambit of SEBI for listing social enterprises 
and voluntary organisations working for the realisation of a social welfare objective so that 
they can raise capital as equity as well as, debt in the country.
Need for Social Stock Exchange: The SSE aims to bridge the financing gap by providing 
alternative fund-raising instruments for achieving socio-development goals. SSE is a 
separate segment of the existing stock exchange, which can help social enterprises like non-
profit organisations (NPOs) and non-government organisations (NGOs) raise funds from 
the public through the stock exchange mechanism. In this way, SSE is expected to stimulate 
the ecosystem of outcome-driven philanthropy in India in a transparent and regulated 
environment. SSE also offers a platform for constructive engagement of NGOs and other 
enterprises working in the area of social projects related to health, education, livelihood 
generation, etc., to directly raise funds from the private sector, corporate entities and 
individuals (including High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs)) and contribute to development 
goals. With the increasing global appetite for socially responsible investments, SSE bridges 
this gap and brings the capital markets closer to the masses for meeting various social 
welfare objectives.
Operationalisation of SSEs: The contributions towards the social sector projects listed 
on SSE are made through a unique security, known as Zero Coupon, Zero Principal (ZCZP) 
instrument as the nature of funding is akin to a donation and, as such, does not promise 
any payment of coupon or return of the principal amount. To scale up this ecosystem, the 
Government has recently extended tax exemption under section 80G of the Income Tax Act, 
1961, to the contributions made through ZCZPs on SSE. Another noteworthy feature of
SSE is that fund-raising on this platform is tied to specific projects undertaken by eligible 
NPOs. These NPOs are mandated to declare their year-wise milestones that are targeted to 
be achieved with funds raised from the public. In this regard, the SEBI (Issue of Capital and 
Disclosure Requirements (ICDR)) Regulations, 2018 identifies broad activities for which 
these potential projects can be undertaken, in areas such as eradication of hunger, poverty, 
malnutrition, and inequality; promotion of healthcare, education, livelihood for rural and 
urban poor; disaster management; and environmental sustainability, among others.
To be listed on SSE, NGOs/NPOs must disclose their past social audit reports, verifying 
proven expertise and commitment to executing social sector projects. As eligibility criteria, 
the regulatory framework requires that the NGOs/NPOs have at least 3 years of field 
experience in executing social sector projects. Further, to ensure accountability of fund-

raisers to fund-providers, entities raising funds on SEE must disclose detailed information 
about their social and environmental performance in an Annual Impact Report within 90 
days from the end of the financial year, duly audited by a social auditor.60  Thus, through its 
rigour, transparency, and scrutiny, the SSE platform ensures that donations reach credible 
entities, inspiring confidence in the ecosystem and paving the way for its scalability as we 
advance.
Progress so far: After the rollout of the regulatory framework for SSE by SEBI, National 
Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) obtained SEBI's in-principal 
approval to set up a separate segment of SSE. As of April 2024, 51 NPOs are registered on 
the BSE, and 50 (11 undergoing renewal) are registered on the NSE. Nine NPOs have raised 
funds on SSE, amounting to a total of ₹ 12.4 crore. These projects span social projects in 
education, livelihood generation, skill development, etc.61  
Gift IFSC: emerging as a dominant gateway for global capital inflows 
into india
2.87	 The IFSC in GIFT City, Gujarat, is envisaged to be a unique international financial 
jurisdiction located inside onshore India, set up with a dual objective of onshoring India-
centric international financial services business as well as serving as a preferred gateway for 
channelising global capital flows into and out of the country. Over the last few years, GIFT 
IFSC has made great strides in achieving both of these objectives. The initiative is a shining 
example of India’s firm commitment to undertake deep, bold and ambitious financial sector 
reforms to attract the global financial services business and gradually become a global leader in 
international finance.  
2.88	 The uniqueness of the IFSC as a distinct financial jurisdiction emanates from three 
fundamental factors. First, the IFSC has been designated as a non-resident zone under the 
Foreign Exchange Management Act, which means that entities set up in the IFSC are outside 
the capital control restrictions and, therefore, can conduct business in any of the eleven notified 
foreign currencies.62 Second, the IFSC has been brought under the regulatory purview of a 
dedicated  and unified financial regulator, i.e. IFSCA (International Financial Services Centres 
Authority), which has been set up under an Act of Parliament. This regulatory intervention by 
the Government has significantly bolstered the attractiveness of IFSC among global investors 
and financial institutions, as they now have to deal with only one Authority for all approvals 
and licenses. Third, through successive Union Budgets, the Government has provided a 
separate tax regime for the IFSC, which is at par with what is available in other leading global 
financial centres.  The competitive tax regime has ensured that financial services institutions 
60 A financial auditor audits financial statements and transactions, keeping in mind the objective of issuing an opinion on the state 
of financial affairs, whereas a social auditor looks at the impact caused on society by the organisation, covering environmental, 
social and economic aspects. SEBI defines a social auditor as an individual registered with a self-regulatory Organisation (SRO) 
under the purview of the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI).

operating from IFSC are not at a disadvantage. The contribution of GIFT IFSC in transforming 
the country's financial industry landscape can be better appreciated by looking at some key 
business activities in GIFT IFSC. 
2.89	 Banking sector: The Banking ecosystem in GIFT IFSC is rapidly evolving with a 
healthy mix of foreign and domestic banks, primarily catering to the foreign currency borrowing 
requirements of Indian corporates and public sector enterprises through external commercial 
borrowing, trade finance, etc. Transactions under these heads, previously booked from foreign 
financial centres such as Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, etc., are now being booked out of GIFT 
IFSC.  As of March 2024, the total asset size of IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) crossed USD 60 
billion, and the cumulative value of transactions undertaken by IBUs crossed USD 795 billion.63 
2.90	 Funds Industry: The robust funds industry in GIFT IFSC has a transformative impact 
in catalysing global capital inflows into India, including the start-up ecosystem. In the last three 
years, there has been rapid growth in Fund Management Entities (FMEs) and AIFs registered 
with IFSCA. As of March 2024, the cumulative FMEs and funds registered rose from 39 and 
33 as of September 2022 to 114 and 120, respectively, as of March 2024. Previously, the 
pooling of international capital for investments in India was structured through funds (private 
equity, venture capital, hedge funds, etc.) set up in offshore jurisdictions. Now, with enabling 
regulations, a competitive tax regime, and beneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is emerging 
as a preferred jurisdiction for the pooling of global capital by foreign and Indian fund managers.
2.91	 Aircraft & ship leasing and financing: The aviation industry in India is on the cusp 
of unprecedented growth, with a strong order book of more than 1500 + aircrafts placed by 
Indian airlines and a projected demand for over 2,200 aircrafts by 2042. Currently, most aircraft 
operated by Indian airlines are leased from offshore lessors that have access to competitive 
capital costs. The aircraft leasing and financing business, the most profitable segment in the 
aviation value chain, was entirely residing in foreign jurisdictions. Recognising the immense 
potential of the aircraft leasing and financing business, IFSCA introduced the enabling leasing 
framework, and the Government supported the endeavour by providing several tax incentives. 
In three years, green shoots have been visible in IFSC, with more than 28 aircraft lessors already 
registered, which have leased more than 120 + aviation assets, including commercial aircraft, 
helicopters, aircraft engines and ground support equipment. Interestingly, Air India has also 
commenced leasing its wide-bodies aircraft from the IFSC Zone.  
2.92	 Considering the critical role of the maritime and shipping industry, the Government and 
IFSCA have taken significant steps to develop a robust ship leasing and financing ecosystem 
in GIFT IFSC. The initial focus is to bring back Indian shipping companies who are leasing/
owning ships out of foreign jurisdiction. With an enabling regulatory framework, the ship 
leasing ecosystem is gaining traction. As of 31 March 2024, the number of ship leasing 
companies registered with IFSCA has risen to 11, underscoring the financial centre's rising 
appeal for maritime business. Furthermore, these companies have acquired and leased four

assets from GIFT IFSC. Going forward, IFSCA intends to work with IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) 
to develop a vibrant ship and aircraft financing ecosystem and contribute towards increasing 
Indian ownership of assets. 
2.93	 Foreign universities initiative: The IFSC, being an offshore jurisdiction, is also 
uniquely positioned to become an ‘international higher education hub’ by attracting top-
quality global universities keenly exploring India due to its talent and demographic profile. 
This opportunity was outlined in the Union Budget FY23, wherein it was stated that ‘World 
Class Foreign Universities and Institutions will be allowed in the GIFT City to offer courses 
in Financial Management, Fintech, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, free 
from domestic regulations, except those by the IFSCA to facilitate the availability of high‑end 
human resources for financial services and technology’. In this endeavour, IFSCA achieved a 
significant milestone in FY24 when Deakin University from Australia became the first foreign 
university to be granted final registration for their International Branch Campus in GIFT IFSC 
under IFSCA (Setting up and operation of International Branch Campus and Offshore Education 
Centre) Regulation, 2022. Additionally, the University of Wollongong from Australia became 
the second foreign university to receive in-principal approval for their International Branch 
Campus in GIFT IFSC. The entry of two foreign universities in GIFT IFSC has paved the way 
for other globally reputed universities to look at this opportunity and contribute to the rise of 
an educated and skilled India. 
2.94	 There are several ongoing reforms to establish IFSC as a reputed international financial 
centre towards achieving the dual mandate of development and regulation of financial services. 
IFSCA is in the process of implementing robust regulatory and supervisory systems backed by 
best-in-class technology. The announcements made in the Union Budget FY24, such as a single 
window IT system for registrations and delegating powers under the SEZ Act to IFSCA to avoid 
dual regulations, will enhance the ease of doing business. The IFSC is expected to emerge as a 
preferred gateway for global capital flows into and out of the country.
Developments in the insurance sector 
Moderation in global insurance markets
2.95	 Global economic slowdown and inflation have raised challenges for insurers. The cost 
of capital is rising with more robust investment returns. Reserve adequacy has emerged as 
a critical consideration as a prolonged period of favourable development wanes due to the 
current and recent shocks of high inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite having a large 
buffer, the pace of industry reserve releases has slowed. In the existing environment, many 
uncertainties prevail, such as delayed settlements, which emerge as a more significant problem 
in periods of high economic and social inflation. The shift of inflation from goods to services 
has impacted liability exposures. In the future, lower claims once disinflation sets in and higher 
returns on interest rate-sensitive investments are expected to support profitability.

Economic Survey 2023-24

2.96	 Considering the abovementioned factors, global insurance markets have witnessed a 
contraction in 2022 compared to the previous year. As per the Swiss Re Institute report on 
World Insurance 202364, total global insurance premiums contracted by 1.1 per cent in real 
terms in 2022, compared to a growth of 3.4 per cent in 2021. However, the non-life insurance 
sector witnessed an increase of 0.5 per cent in 2022, though lower than the 2.6 per cent growth 
registered in 2021, driven by rate hardening in commercial lines in developed markets. In the 
life insurance segment, global premiums contracted by 3.1 per cent in 2022, compared to a 
growth of 4.5 per cent in 2021. 
India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the 
coming decade
2.97	 Economic growth, an expanding middle class, innovation, and regulatory support 
have driven insurance market growth in India. In FY23, premium growth moderated slightly 
compared to the previous year, reflecting still-in-process adjustments to the post-COVID-19 
era. Overall insurance penetration65 in India moderated slightly to 4 per cent in FY23, from 4.2 
per cent in FY22. During the same period, insurance penetration in the life-insurance segment 
declined from 3.2 per cent in FY22 to 3 per cent in FY23, while it remained flat at 1 per cent for 
the non-life insurance segment. Overall insurance density66  increased from USD 91 in FY22 to 
USD 92 in FY23. In the life insurance segment, it rose from USD 69 in FY22 to USD 70 in FY23 
and remained stable in the non-life insurance segment.67
2.98	 As per the Swiss Re Institute Report,68  Life premium growth in India is estimated to 
slow to 4.1 per cent in FY23 (higher than the historical average of 3.2 per cent during 2012-
2021) from 5.9 per cent in FY22 as memories (i.e., risk awareness) of the pandemic faded and a 
recent change in tax norms for high-ticket policies69  weighed on new premium growth. Owing 
to these factors, new business premiums, after growing by 40 per cent in the first quarter of 
FY22, contracted in the fourth quarter (7 per cent). The momentum continued in FY23 as well, 
with new business premiums in the second quarter declining by 21.2 per cent, mainly due to a 
contraction in the group insurance business.
Status of Non-Life Insurance segment
2.99	 Non-life premium growth moderated slightly from 9 per cent in FY22 to an estimated 
7.7 per cent in FY23 (lower than the historical average of 8 per cent during 2012-2021) as the 
market stabilised after the pandemic. Growth in almost all lines of business slowed last year

69 Under this regulation, any proceeds from a life insurance policy with an annual premium exceeding ₹5 lakh are subject to 
taxation. As a result, section 10(10) of the Income Tax Act, previously offering exemptions, no longer applies to policies with 
premiums surpassing this threshold.

as the industry stabilised after the pandemic. The sector faces headwinds such as economic 
slowdown, high interest rates, and elevated retail and medical inflation.
2.100	Health accounts for around 35 per cent of sector premiums written in FY23. With an 
estimated increase of 11 per cent in premiums, health saw the fastest growth amongst all non-
life lines in FY23. Increased health awareness, supportive government policies, rising medical 
costs and innovations in Insurtech have supported this growth. Although price and income 
constraints may limit demand for the lower income groups, the expanding middle class and 
increased discretionary spending are expected to support overall growth. Further, to provide 
health insurance to low-income households, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya 
Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and State government extension schemes are in place. Recently, AB-
PMJAY achieved a milestone of generating 34.2 crore Ayushman cards across India, with 49.3 
per cent of them held by females. In the medium term, health premiums are projected to grow 
by 9.7 per cent annually in 2024-28, with regulatory initiatives to improve the attractiveness of 
insurance offering some support. 
2.101	 Agriculture insurance is another line of business, accounting for around 12 per cent of 
the non-life insurance market. The agriculture insurance is estimated to register a flat growth 
in FY23 due to a sharp decline in premium rates in the Kharif cropping season. The decline 
was more than offset by increased insured land area and farmer enrolments during the season. 
Agriculture premiums will likely rise from 2024 onwards, with an average real premium growth 
of 2.5 per cent over the medium term, supported by improvements in insurance infrastructure 
such as mobile applications and remote sensing for crop loss monitoring. The Government has 
launched various initiatives to address current concerns around crop insurance. These include 
the launch of new technological initiatives such as the YES-Tech Manual, WINDS portal, and 
enrolment app AIDE/Sahayak to assess crop damage via satellite-based advanced technologies, 
and with door-to-door enrolment initiatives making cover more accessible. 
2.102	The Government and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) 
have taken several steps to support industry growth. Paramount among these is the mission 
“Insurance for all by 2047”, launched in November 2022, to ensure that every citizen and 
enterprise has appropriate insurance cover/solution. Three major initiatives, Bima Sugam,70 
Bima Vahak,71 and Bima Vistaar72 are expected to be launched, aiming to raise insurance 
penetration, particularly in semi-urban areas, rural towns, and villages. 
2.103	The IRDAI approved amendments to the reinsurance regulations to position India 
as a global reinsurance hub. Fundamental changes include reducing Foreign Reinsurance 
Branches’ (FRB) minimum capital requirement to USD 6.1 million from USD 12.2 million and 
streamlining the regulator’s order of preference of cession by Indian insurers to reinsurers to

four from six levels. Reinsurance formats have been simplified, and the International Financial 
Service Centre Insurance Offices’ (IIOs) framework has been aligned with that of the IFSCA 
rules for better competitiveness.
2.104	A comprehensive regulatory review has been undertaken, transitioning from a rule-
based approach to a principle-based architecture while establishing a resilient and robust 
risk management framework. Streamlining the operations, 167 circulars and 82 returns have 
been repealed, while 78 regulations have been amended, consolidated, and reduced to 28. 
The regulatory clearance processes for insurance products have also been replaced from the 
erstwhile requirement of prior approval under the ‘File and Use’ regime, with all the products 
under the general and health insurance and the majority of the life insurance products being 
required to follow ‘Use and File’ procedures which facilitate insurers to launch the products 
quickly considering the market dynamics. 
2.105	Various regulatory stipulations have also been removed for product offerings under all 
the segments, focusing on the health insurance segment to provide enhanced coverage and 
choice to customers. Further, to empower policyholders with a deeper understanding of their 
insurance coverage, issuance of a concise Customer Information Sheet (CIS) to the policyholders 
has been made compulsory for all types of insurance policies. 
2.106	Further, to make the industry future-ready and align with global standards, significant 
progress has been made towards the implementation of the Risk-Based Supervisory Framework, 
Risk-Based Capital Framework, and International Financial Reporting Standards. The IRDAI 
facilitates coordinated efforts between insurers and state governments through state insurance 
plans to take insurance services to the last mile and even the remotest parts of the country. 
2.107	These reforms and sustained economic growth are expected to facilitate the continued 
development and advancement of the insurance sector supported by robust economic growth, 
an expanding middle class, innovation, and strong policy support. There are favourable 
projections for the Indian Insurance market. The Swiss-Re Institute January 2024 report73 
projected that over the next five years (2024-28), total insurance premiums in India will grow 
by 7.1 per cent in real terms, well above the global (2.4 per cent), emerging economies (5.1 
per cent) and advanced economies (1.7 per cent) market averages. At this rate, India will have 
the fastest-growing insurance sector amongst the G20 countries. Insurance penetration as a 
per cent of GDP is projected to grow from 3.8 per cent in FY23 to 4.3 per cent by FY35. The 
growth in life business (premiums up 6.7 per cent in 2024-28) is likely to be supported by rising 
demand for term life cover by the middle class, the country’s young population and increasing 
industry adoption of Insurtech. Non-life premiums are projected to grow at an annual average 
of 8.3 per cent during 2024-28, driven by economic growth, improvement in distribution 
channels, government support and a favourable regulatory environment. Further, over the next

77
decade (2024-34), total premiums are expected to more than double (inflation-adjusted), and 
insurance penetration will increase from 3.8 per cent presently to 4.5 per cent in 2034.
2.108	For the anticipated rise in insurance penetration to materialise, the industry has to 
become more customer-friendly. According to the Annual Report of IRDAI for FY2374, the 
centralised grievance portal received over two lakhs of complaints during the year. If the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India is excluded, over 50 per cent of the complaints against life 
insurers were about unfair business practices, a euphemism for mis-selling. Further, 66 per 
cent of the complaints against general insurers were about claims, including delayed and denied 
settlements. The industry has to think and work for the long term. Insurance penetration will 
not rise. Data for FY23 showed a decline in insurance penetration. When it comes to financial 
products, globally, ‘soft-touch’ regulations have seldom worked over a sustained period in 
delivering customer satisfaction and value for money.75 Globally, the private financial sector 
has repeatedly shown itself to be adept at selective or misinterpretation of principles-based 
regulations to its benefit.
Developments in the pension sector
2.109	The demographic structure of most countries is changing significantly as birth rates 
continue to fall. This development has significant consequences for pay-as-you-go pension 
arrangements, which rely on the next generation of taxpayers to fund the pensions paid to 
previous generations. In the recent past, the re-emergence of inflation has also damaged the 
community’s confidence in the ability of pension programs to deliver adequate retirement 
benefits over the longer term. Although inflation has declined in some economies, its persistence 
has highlighted this risk to current and future retirees. At the same time, there is an ongoing 
global shift away from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) arrangements, in which 
individuals carry all risks relating to investment returns, inflation and, often, longevity. Very 
few systems have solved the dilemma of moving from an individual-based DC accumulation 
system to a post-retirement system that provides adequate and secure income to retirees while 
providing them the same flexibility available during their working years.
2.110	 An ongoing challenge facing many pension systems is the inclusion of gig workers and 
those in the informal labour market. In many economies, the labour market is fracturing; 
therefore, the stable or structured employer-employee relationship is disappearing. In such 
circumstances, pension arrangements must become more individually focused and less reliant 
on third parties.76

Performance of India’s Pension Sector
2.111	 According to the 15th Annual Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index (MCGPI)77, 
India’s overall global pension index value improved from 44.5 in 2022 to 45.9 in 2023, 
primarily due to an improvement in adequacy and sustainability sub-indices. India's pension 
system comprises an earnings-related employee pension scheme, a defined contribution 
Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and supplementary employer-managed pension schemes that 
are essentially by way of DC. Changes in workforce dynamics, employment, and family patterns 
have brought formal sources of retirement to the forefront. While there is improvement in the 
net pension replacement rate and participation in private pension plans, which is reflected 
in the value of adequacy and sustainability sub-indices, the coverage of the Indian workforce 
under private pension plans is yet to be enhanced.78 The Government has launched various 
schemes as part of the universal social security programme to benefit the unorganised sector.
2.112	 India's pension sector has expanded since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme 
(NPS) and, more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The total number of subscribers 
stood at 735.6 lakh as of March 2024, registering a YoY growth of 18 per cent from 623.6 lakh 
as of March 2023. The total number of APY subscribers (including its earlier version, NPS Lite) 
increased from 501.2 lakh as of March 2023 to 588.4 lakh as of March 2024. APY subscribers 
account for around 80 per cent of the pension subscriber base.79 
2.113	 Disaggregated data of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of 
India (PFRDA) shows that APY subscribers have witnessed an improvement in gender mix, 
with female subscriber share rising from 37.2 per cent in FY17 to 48.5 per cent in FY23. The 
age mix is increasing also in favour of the younger cohort in the age group of 18-25, from a 
share of 35 per cent in FY17 to 46.7 per cent in FY23 However, the bulks, about 92 per cent, 
of APY accounts are for a pension amount of ₹1,000 per month, followed by 4.7 per cent for 
₹5,000. The overwhelming share of ₹1,000 pension in APY could be due to several factors, the 
predominant cause being that the target population is low-income households where day-to-
day consumption expenditure takes precedence over savings.80 
2.114	 The population's pension coverage under these two schemes (NPS & APY) as a share of 
the total population has increased from 1.2 per cent in FY17 to 5.3 per cent in FY24. AuM under 
these schemes as a proportion of GDP has risen from 1.1 per cent in FY17 to 4 per cent in FY24. 
Outlook for the Pension Sector
2.115	 In the future, NPS (private sector) is poised to expand rapidly as an increasing number 
of corporate employees and relatively better-off households, for example, self-employed and 
77 The Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index benchmarks 47 retirement income systems around the world, highlighting 
challenges and opportunities within each. The index is made up of three sub-indices, adequacy, sustainability, and integrity 
that measure each retirement income system against more than 50 indicators
78 Presently, 6 per cent of the Indian workforce is covered under private pension plans, as per the 15th Annual MCGPI.

79
professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and small business owners, see the merit of joining NPS. 
There is a potential for NPS in rural areas for larger farmers, traders, and those with lumpy 
incomes, as it does not require a standard monthly contribution.
2.116	 There is a tremendous scope for growth as India’s per capita income rises further and 
transitions to a high-middle-income country. India’s demographic structure, with a more 
significant proportion of younger people, favours a phase of accumulation. Since life expectancy 
is inching up, the need for a steady income stream is also increasing to mitigate old-age poverty. 
Further, as the traditional family support system changes with growing urbanisation, there is 
even a greater necessity for an independent source of income in old age.
2.117	 Financial literacy becomes essential for people to reap the benefits of the formal financial 
sector. There are many facets to pension literacy; women in the family must have a pension 
account given their higher longevity; it is prudent to empower young adults, particularly 
students, with a pension account so that they imbibe the financial discipline of long-term 
saving.
2.118	 Financial inclusion and empowerment will only be complete with each family member's 
pension account. In this direction, given the nature of the pension product where the payoff 
is not immediate, it needs a nudge by all concerned, the employers, intermediaries, the 
Government, and the pension regulator, to induce people, particularly young adults, to join 
a pension scheme. There is immense merit in joining young as, with small contributions, a 
sizeable corpus could be accumulated given the power of compounding, providing substantial 
steady income in one’s post-working life.
Mechanisms to ensure regulatory coordination and overall financial 
stability
2.119	 The financial system's stability is paramount for sustainable economic growth and 
prosperity. A financially stable system should be robust to macroeconomic disturbances. It 
should withstand unforeseen shocks so that there is a high degree of confidence that it will 
continue to meet its contractual obligations. Financial stability means not only an absence 
of actual crisis but also the ability of the system to limit and manage imbalances before they 
assume a magnitude that threatens itself or the economic processes.
2.120	The role of the Government in ensuring financial stability is multifaceted and crucial. 
Governments worldwide employ various policies, regulations, and measures to safeguard the 
integrity and smooth functioning of the financial sector. It would also be essential to assess how 
financial instability interacts with the real economy to either amplify or moderate the effects of 
initial shocks. Thus, regulators responsible for oversight of different financial institutions must 
interact and cooperate closely among themselves and with those responsible for the stability of 
prices and the real economy. 

Economic Survey 2023-24

2.121	 In the Indian context, the Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC)81  is a forum that 
facilitates interaction among various financial sector regulators.  It  is mandated to deal with a 
wide range of issues relating to financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory 
coordination, financial literacy and financial inclusion, macro-prudential supervision of the 
economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates, coordinating India’s 
international interface with financial sector bodies (like Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 
Financial Stability Board (FSB)) and any other matter relating to the financial sector stability 
and development referred by a Member/Chairperson and considered prudent by the Council. 
2.122	Under the FSDC, the FSDC sub-committee (FSDC-SC) is a forum chaired by the RBI 
Governor which deliberate on agenda items proposed by any of the members along with 
supportive actions required. Further, the RBI promotes the financial sector's resilience by 
regulating financial institutions, monitoring systemic risks, and implementing monetary

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for India 
2.123	FSAP is the quinquennial exercise jointly conducted by the IMF and the World Bank 
in countries having ‘systemically important’ financial sectors. FSAP involves a comprehensive 
and in-depth analysis of a country’s financial industry to assess financial stability and financial 
sector development. India underwent its first FSAP exercise in 2011-12 and the second one 
in 2017, after which IMF-World Bank published its reports, including the Financial System 
Stability Assessment Report (FSSA) and Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report. The third 
FSAP exercise for India is underway for 2023-24. The FSSA and FSA reports will be published 
by February 2025.FSB publishes its annual report on the Implementation and effects of the G20 
financial regulatory reforms, mentioning implementation status across various jurisdictions.

of implementing the other two requirements under Basel III, that is, revised leverage ratio 
requirements and risk-based capital framework.
2.125	For the compensation pillar, India already has in place Standards for Sound Compensation 
Practices (Principles and Standards) for significant banks, insurers, and asset managers in 
India.
2.126	Under the OTC derivatives segment, India made significant progress in 2023 from 
the 2022 FSB assessment, as more than 90 per cent of the OTC derivatives now follow trade 
reporting, central clearing and platform trading requirements under FSB principles. The fourth 
parameter under the OTC pillar, that is, margin requirements concerning OTC derivatives, is 
currently under implementation.
2.127	 Enhancing the resilience of NBFI is an important priority of FSB, which under key reforms 
area is bucketed under Money Market Mutual Funds, Securitisation and Securities Financing 
Transactions (SFT) requirements.  India is the only jurisdiction among 24 reported by FSB in 
total compliance with SFT requirements including minimum regulatory standards for collateral 
valuation and management, numerical haircut floors on bank-to-non-bank transactions, etc. 
India has actively undertaken securitisation and MMFs reforms in line with FSB principles. 
Financial System Stress Indicator
2.128	The RBI, in the 26th issue of its FSR85, attempted to compile a comprehensive indicator 
called the financial system stress indicator (FSSI)86 to monitor the aggregate stress level in the 
Indian financial system. FSSI aims to (a) help identify periods of stress, (b) assess the intensity 
and duration of stress in the financial system, and (c) gauge the ability of financial markets and 
intermediaries to withstand shocks and imbalances. 
2.129	The latest FSR of June 2024 shows that FSSI indicated a gradual easing of stress during H2 
of FY24. The decline in stress indicators has been broad-based, except for the NBFC and money 
market segments. The decline in government debt market stress was the primary contributor 
to the improvement in the overall FSSI, aided by a fall in long-term yields as well as volatility 
and higher net foreign portfolio debt inflows. Meanwhile, declining volatility and rangebound 
movement in the exchange rate reduced stress levels in the foreign exchange market. Money 
market stress indicators inched up as tight liquidity in the banking system led to higher interest 
rates on money market instruments (e.g., Commercial Papers and Certificate of Deposits). The 
banking system stress indicator remained subdued, supported by improving soundness. The real

corporate debt markets and three groups of financial intermediary segments, namely, banks, NBFCs and AMC-MFs. It also 
features a real sector component encompassing select real sector variables that have a bearing on financial stability due to 
their strong interlinkages with the financial sector. For more details, refer: https://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.

borrowing costs increased.

ASSESSMENT AND OUTLOOK
2.130	On most counts, India's financial industry has progressed over time. Domestic credit to 
the private sector as a per cent of GDP rose from 50.6 per cent in 2010 to 54.7 per cent in 2021. 
Gross and Net NPAs of SCBs have been declining over time, accompanied by an improvement 
in CRAR, RoA and RoE. Despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty, India’s stock markets 
have been stable.

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
83
2.131	 Even as banks, non-banks and corporates battled balance-sheet excesses, the consequences 
of the credit boom of the first decade of the new millennium and the inevitable bust that followed 
in the second decade, the broad industry kept advancing the cause of financial inclusion and 
financial deepening. As India embarks on the vision to become a developed country by 2047, 
it is imperative that financial intermediation costs decline globally. India has made significant 
strides in this regard, which may be one reason for its resilient post-Covid economic recovery. 
However, much work could be done to make it a global financial leader.
2.132	The outlook for India’s financial sector appears bright. The vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 
is indeed an opportunity for a prosperous society, robust financial services sector, strong public 
finances, and economic sovereignty. The elements of a robust financial services sector include 
a highly competitive and viable banking sector, universal access to banking and other financial 
services for all citizens, lowest intermediation costs, efficient and quick access to credit and 
equity funding for small businesses, highly liquid, efficient, and well-regulated stock, bond, and 
commodity markets. India’s financial sector needs to support capital formation and promote 
trade, business, and investments in MSMEs, enabling them to scale It also needs to provide 
insurance protection and retirement security to all citizens. The share of insurance and pension 
fund assets in GDP stands at 19 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in India, compared to a 
high of 52 per cent and 122 per cent in the USA and 112 per cent and 80 per cent in the UK, 
leaning scope for further improvements. 
2.133	The next big step in the coming years is likely to be towards Artificial Intelligence/
Machine Learning (AI/ML), Decentralised Finance, Internet of Things (IoT), etc., which have 
a vast potential to disrupt the digital payments ecosystem. Further, the vision is for India to 
evolve as a ‘fintech nation’ with the highest number of fintech firms and the highest fintech 
adoption rate by incumbents fuelled by digital public infrastructure. An approach should be 
evolved for common user data, e.g. KYC, across Regulators. In the medium term, efforts should 
be made to move towards data-based lending instead of judgment-based lending, especially 
for small businesses. In this regard, there is a need for continuous review to identify regulatory 
gaps/overlaps and benchmark them with the best global practices. Financial sector firms – 
public or privately owned – must become customer-centric. Without that, most quantitative 
metrics will remain elusive.
2.134	The Indian financial sector is at a turnpike moment. The dominance of banking support 
to credit is being reduced, and the role of capital markets is rising. For a country that aspires to 
be a developed nation by 2047, this is a long-awaited and welcome development. Being reliant 
on and exposed to the capital market, however, comes with its challenges and trade-offs. As 
India’s financial sector undergoes this critical transformation, it must also brace for likely 
vulnerabilities and prepare itself with regulatory and government policy levers to intervene 
and hedge, as required.

CHAPTER

PRICES AND INFLATION: 
UNDER CONTROL
The pandemic and subsequent geo-political tensions presented considerable challenges 
to the global economy in inflation management. The supply disruptions inflicted by 
the pandemic and increased commodity prices caused by heightened global conflicts 
markedly affected India. As a result, FY22 and FY23 witnessed price pressures in core 
consumer goods and services. Food prices were affected by adverse weather conditions 
in the last two years. The net impact of these developments was elevated inflationary 
pressures in FY23 and FY24. Prudent monetary policy response and calibrated trade 
policy measures by the Government, coupled with strong output growth, helped reduce 
core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Appropriate administrative actions, including 
dynamic stock management, open market operations, subsidised provision of essential 
food items and trade policy measures, helped mitigate food inflation to a great extent. 
The expectation of a normal monsoon and moderating global prices of key imported 
items give credence to the benign and range-bound inflation projections for India made 
by the Reserve Bank of India and the International Monetary Fund. Beyond this, the 
medium to long-term inflation outlook will be shaped by the strengthening of price 
monitoring mechanisms and market intelligence as well as focussed efforts to increase 
the domestic production of essential food items like pulses and edible oils for which 
India has a great degree of import dependence.
INTRODUCTION
3.1	
Low and stable inflation is key to sustaining economic growth. Governments and Central 
Banks face the challenge of keeping inflation at a moderate level while ensuring financial 
stability. Achieving this delicate balance requires careful monitoring of economic indicators 
and taking appropriate and timely corrective actions. With the commitment of the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) to the goal of price stability and policy actions by the Central Government, 
India successfully managed to keep retail inflation at 5.4 per cent in FY24, the lowest level since 
the Covid-19 pandemic period (‘pandemic’ hereinafter).
3.2.	 After the pandemic, the global economy experienced another set of supply chain disruptions 
beginning with the Russia-Ukraine war in the first half of FY23. In the latter half of the year and 
FY24, there was a decline in global inflation because of the diminishing impact of price shocks, 
particularly in energy prices, as well as lower core inflation and monetary tightening. According 
to the International Monetary Fund1, the coordinated monetary tightening by Central Banks in

major advanced economies during 2022-23 significantly contributed to the decline in energy 
prices due to its high level of synchronisation and the resulting impact on reducing global 
energy demand.
India’s retail inflation is lower than the EMDEs and world average
3.3.	 Despite the synchronous tightening of monetary policy by most central banks to restore 
price stability, the global economy has shown unexpected resilience in 2023. This is evident in 
both advanced economies (AEs), and emerging markets & developing economies (EMDEs), as 
they are returning to their inflation targets. This trend is also observed in India. As per the IMF2 
data, where India’s inflation rate was lower than the global average and that of EMDEs in 2022 
and 2023. 
3.4.	 There is a clear negative relationship between cross-country inflation and per capita GDP. 
Historically, inflation in advanced economies has generally been lower than in EMDEs. Factors 
such as established monetary policies, economic stability, well-developed and efficient markets 
that balance supply and demand conditions, and stable currencies contribute to the effective 
management of inflation (Ha, Kose & Ohnsurge, 2018)3.

system, and the trade-off between inflation and other economic objectives may influence these 
targets (Jahan, Sarwat)4. In pursuit of specific inflation targets set by countries, they employ 
various policies and measures. Interestingly, India is performing better than various developed 
and emerging economies in relation to its inflation target. 
3.6.	 In 2023, India's inflation rate was within its target range of 2 to 6 per cent. Compared 
to advanced economies like the USA, Germany, and France, India had one of the lowest 
deviations from its inflation target in the triennial average inflation from 2021-2023. Despite 
the challenges posed by global demand-supply imbalances due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, 
India’s inflation rate was 1.4 percentage points below the global average in 2023. Against this 
background, the survey discusses trends and drivers of retail inflation and its constituents – 
headline, core, and food inflation, state-wise variations in retail inflation, rural-urban inflation 
differential and fiscal policy measures undertaken to contain inflation as the chapter proceeds.

DOMESTIC RETAIL INFLATION
Retail inflation moderated gradually in FY24 
3.7.	 Since 2020, countries have been facing challenges in controlling inflation. In FY23, 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation in India was primarily influenced by higher 
food inflation, while core inflation remained moderate. Externally, the Russia-Ukraine war led 
to price pressures, while domestically, excessive heat in the summer and uneven rainfall put 
pressure on food prices.

3.8.	 However, since May 2022, monetary policy broadly focused on absorbing excess liquidity 
in the system by increasing the policy repo rate by 250 basis points from 4 per cent in May 2022 
to 6.5 per cent in February 2023. Thereafter, the policy rate was kept unchanged by focusing 
on the gradual withdrawal of accommodation, aiming to align inflation with the target, while 
simultaneously fostering growth. Consequently, the persistent and sticky core inflation observed 
in FY23 declined to 3.1 per cent in June 2024.

3.9.	 As the global energy price index experienced a sharp decline in FY24, retail fuel inflation 
also stayed low. The Central Government's announcement of price cuts for LPG, petrol, and 
diesel led to lower LPG and petroleum product inflation. In August 2023, the price of a domestic 
LPG cylinder was reduced by ₹200 per cylinder in all markets across the country. As a result, 
LPG inflation rate has been in the deflationary zone since September 2023. Again in March 
2024, the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders was reduced by ₹100 per cylinder. Similarly, 
in March 2024, the Central Government lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹2 per litre. 
Subsequently, retail inflation in petrol and diesel used in vehicles moved to the deflationary 
zone in March 2024. Additionally, global commodity prices declined in 2023, reducing price 
pressure in energy, metals, minerals, and agricultural commodities through the imported 
inflation channel. Low fuel and core inflation ensured a downward trajectory for headline 
inflation, despite volatility in food prices in FY24.
3.10.	Thus, moderation in inflation was largely the result of prudent administrative measures 
and monetary policies implemented during the post-pandemic economic recovery phase. As 
per the recent data released by MoSPI, the retail inflation rate was 5.1 per cent in June 2024. In 
view of this, the following section examines the detailed trends and patterns in core and food 
inflation.

CORE INFLATION DYNAMICS IN THE POST-PANDEMIC 
WORLD
Core inflation hits a four-year low in FY24
3.11.	 Core inflation is measured by excluding food and energy items from CPI headline 
inflation. It assesses the underlying price trends by largely eliminating the impact of price 
volatilities arising from transitory supply shocks. The following discussion splits core inflation 
into its goods and services components. Core goods are further split into consumer durables 
and consumer non-durables. The items and weights to segregate core goods and services 
indices is given in Annexure 1. The breakdown of core inflation into its components is given in 
Chart III.11.

3.12.	From the pandemic-driven highs, inflationary pressures in India eased in FY22, aided 
by softening food inflation. However, core inflation had risen to 6 per cent at the same time, 
driven primarily by rising international commodity prices. As Chart III.12 shows, core services 
inflation inched up in the year, but the increase was lower than that of core consumer goods. 
3.13.	Inflationary pressures firmed up in FY23 yet again driven by the Russia-Ukraine war 
disrupting the recouping supply chains leading to a rise in food and fuel prices. As economic 
activity gained momentum, core inflation also increased slightly and was primarily driven by 
core services inflation as house rents went up, with people returning to urban areas (Chart 
III.15). In FY24, the price situation improved. CPI inflation moderated, driven by a decline 
in core inflation -both goods and services. Core services inflation eased to a nine-year low in 
FY24; at the same time, core goods inflation also declined to a four-year low.  
3.14.	Trends in core inflation are important in determining the contours of monetary policy. 
Assessing the emerging patterns of price pressures, the RBI increased the repo rate gradually 
by 250 basis points since May 2022 to reign inflationary pressures. Chart III.13 indicates the 
impact of monetary policy transmission on core inflation, which declined around 4 percentage 
points between April 2022 and June 2024.

A steep decline in service prices hastens moderation in core inflation
3.15.	 Stubborn core services prices are a risk factor for the inflation outlook of advanced 
economies (Box III.1). In contrast, India’s core services inflation reached a nine-year low in 
FY24. This was aided by moderation in housing rental inflation, with a significant increase in 
the stock of new houses in 20235.

Box III.1: Elevated risks for core services inflation in advanced economies
As per the March 2024 Quarterly Review of the Bank of International Settlements6, while 
there was a discernible retreat in the prices of food, energy and core goods following the 
gradual normalisation of the supply chain in 2023, the core services inflation remained 
elevated in 2023. The review also showed that the recent pace of deceleration in core goods 
prices closely matches the previous cases, while at the same time, the price growth in services 
has been more stubborn than it was in past inflation episodes. The persistent nature of 
service inflation is because of the much higher labour intensity in services. Rising housing 
prices also contributed to this.  
These dynamics have played out similarly across countries and regions but less so in Asian 
emerging market economies and Latin America (Chart III.16). Going ahead, the persistence 
in the inflation of services has larger implications for AEs than for Emerging Market 
Economies (EMEs). This is because services carry a larger share in consumer price indices 
of AEs, posing a greater risk to their headline inflation outlook.

Consumer durable inflation remains elevated but softens in FY24 
3.16.	Consumer durables inflation increased progressively between FY20 and FY23 by more 
than 5 percentage points. FY21 witnessed a considerable increase in gold prices, a key component 
of the personal care category of CPI. In FY22 and FY23, clothing, which accounts for 48 per 
cent of weightage in the consumer durable index, was a major driver of inflation.  The surge 
in the prices of key input materials used by apparel manufacturers, particularly cotton, led to 
this. With the improvement in the supply of key raw materials, the inflation rate for consumer 
durables declined in FY24. However, record-high gold prices, driven by anticipated Fed rate 
cuts and escalating geopolitical uncertainty, have exerted upward pressure on overall durables 
inflation.

Core consumer non-durable inflation declines steeply
3.17.	 Consumer non-durables (CND) in the CPI basket have three components—food and 
beverages, fuel and other consumption items (details in Annexure 1). This section examines 
the other core consumer non-durable components (other consumption items of CND) only. 
Subsequent sections will examine ‘food and beverages’ while ‘fuel and light’ has already been 
elaborated in paragraph 3.9. While the core CND inflation plunged in FY20, it started to inch up 
in FY21, reached an all-time in FY22, and declined sharply in FY23 and FY24. The underlying 
cause for this has mainly been changes in the cost of transport components.

FOOD INFLATION
Food price pressures due to adverse weather conditions
3.18.	Food inflation has been a global phenomenon in the last two years. Research7  indicates the 
rising vulnerability of food prices to climate change – heat waves, uneven monsoon distribution, 
unseasonal rainfall, hailstorms, torrential rainfall and historic dry conditions (Patra, John 
& George, 2024). In FY23 and FY24, the agriculture sector was affected by extreme weather 
events, lower reservoir levels, and damaged crops that adversely affected farm output and food 
prices. So, food inflation based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) increased from 3.8 
per cent in FY22 to 6.6 per cent in FY23 and further to 7.5 per cent in FY24.

Reasons for price pressures in major food items
3.19.	The production prospects of vegetables and pulses were particularly impacted by 
unfavourable weather conditions. The increase in tomato prices in July 2023 was caused by 
seasonal changes in crop production, region-specific crop diseases such as white fly infestation, 
and the early arrival of monsoon rains in the northern part of the country. There were also 
logistics disruptions in isolated areas due to heavy rains. The spike in onion prices was due 
to several factors, including rainfall during the last harvesting season affecting the quality of 
rabi onions, delays in sowing during the kharif season, prolonged dry spells impacting kharif 
production, and trade-related measures taken by other countries. 
3.20.	The prices of pulses, particularly of tur, increased due to low production over the past 
two years, caused by adverse weather conditions. Urad production was affected by slow sowing 
progress in the rabi season coupled with climatic disturbances in the southern states. The area 
and output of gram was also lower compared to the previous rabi season.
3.21.	Since the beginning of 2023, there has been an increase in the price of milk. This is due 
to a decrease in artificial inseminations during the peak days of the pandemic, as well as higher 
costs for animal feed. The milk cooperatives increased the price of milk and milk products to 
account for increased costs. The milk price increase moderated by the end of FY24.
3.22.	However, the government took prompt actions, including open market sales, retailing 
in specified outlets, and timely imports, to ensure an adequate supply of essential food items 
(Box III.2). Additionally, to ensure food security for the poor, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan 
Anna Yojana, which provides free food grains to more than 81 crore beneficiaries, was extended 
for a period of five years starting from January 2024.

Box III.2: Administrative measures to contain food inflation in FY24
Wheat/Atta
●  Export of wheat flour, maida and semolina was placed under a prohibited category since 
August 2022.
●  To prevent hoarding and unscrupulous speculation, stock limits were imposed on wheat 
from June 2023 to March 2024. 
●  In November 2023, the Government introduced Bharat Atta at a subsidised price of 
₹27.50 per kg to make it affordable for consumers.
●  Wheat and rice are offloaded periodically from the central pool under open market sale.
Rice/Paddy
●  The Government placed the export of broken rice and non-basmati rice under the 
prohibited category in September 2022 and July 2023, respectively. 
●  To prevent the export of non-basmati rice under the garb of basmati rice, the floor price 
for the export of basmati rice was fixed in October 2023. 
●  To maintain adequate stock and to keep domestic prices under check, the Government 
imposed a 20 per cent export duty on parboiled rice until 31 March 2024.
●  In February 2024, the Government mandated to declare the stock position of rice/paddy 
by traders/wholesalers, retailers, big chain retailers and processors/millers. 
●  In February 2024, the Government introduced Bharat Rice at a subsidised price of ₹29 
per kg for selling through NAFED, NCCF and Kendriya Bhandar. 
Pulses
●  Calibrated release of stocks from the buffer of pulses is being done to ensure availability 
and affordability to consumers.
●  To augment domestic availability and moderate the prices of pulses, import of tur and 
urad has been kept under ‘Free Category’ until 31 March 2025. Basic import duty on 
masur was reduced to zero until 31 March 2024.
●  The Government launched Bharat Dal in July 2023 to convert chana stock into chana 
dal for retail disposal at a highly subsidised rate. Later, the Bharat Dal was extended to 
include Moong Dal and Moong Sabut.
●  Besides, India imported considerable quantities of Tur (mainly from Mozambique, 
Myanmar, Tanzania, Sudan and Malawi), Masur (mainly from Australia, Canada and 
Russia) and Urad (mainly from Myanmar) in FY24.
Onion
●  The onion buffer size under PSF was increased from 1.00 LMT in FY21 to 7.00 LMT 
in FY24. The stock was released through retail sales, e-Nam auctions and bulk sales in 
wholesale markets. 
●  The Government placed a Minimum Export Price on specific varieties of onion from 
October 2023 to December 2023. 
●  In December 2023, the export policy of onions was amended from the ‘free’ to the 
‘prohibited’ category until 31 March 2024.

Economic Survey 2023-24

Edible Oils
●  The basic duty on crude palm oil, crude soyabean oil, and crude sunflower oil was cut 
from 2.5 per cent to nil. The agri-cess on oil was reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. 
In January 2024, this duty structure was extended until 31 March 2025.
●  The reduced basic duty structure on refined soybean oil, refined sunflower oil and refined 
palm oil was extended until 31 March 2025.
●  Free import of refined palm oils was extended till further orders.
Sugar
●  In October 2023, the Government extended the date of restrictions on the export of 
sugar (raw sugar, white sugar, refined sugar and organic sugar) beyond 31 October 2023 
until further orders.
Global food prices and domestic inflation
3.23.	In India, the edible oil market heavily depends on imports, with more than 50 per cent 
of the total edible oil requirement being imported8, making it sensitive to global prices. The 
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) edible oils price index fluctuation is a key indicator 
of these global price trends. The recent downward trend in this index is broadly correlated with 
the decline in domestic edible oil prices in India. As a result, the Government closely monitors 
global market trends to ensure the availability of edible oils for consumers at an affordable 
price. Efforts are also made to balance imports with domestic production to mitigate the risks 
associated with global price volatility. In this context, the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil 
Palm aims to increase domestic crude palm oil production to reduce the import burden.
3.24.	 In the case of sugar, the Government announced restrictions on export in June 2022 to 
ensure sufficient local supplies and thereby manage sugar inflation. These export restrictions 
have indeed played a role in stabilising domestic sugar prices. As a result, even though the 
global sugar price index inflated and has been showing volatility since February 2023, domestic 
sugar prices have remained much less volatile.

INTERSTATE VARIATIONS IN RETAIL INFLATION 
3.25.	Consistent with the decline in the all-India average retail inflation rate in FY24 compared 
to FY23, inflation in most States and Union Territories (UTs) decreased. The inflation rate was 
less than 6 per cent in 29 out of the 36 States and Union Territories. 
Chart III.24:Interstate variations in retail inflation (%) in FY24
     Source: Prepared from Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI
Interstate variations in inflation are more pronounced in rural areas
3.26.	The rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than 
the urban (29.6%). Hence, in the last two years, States that witnessed elevated food prices 
also experienced higher rural inflation. It is also found that the inter-state variation calculated 
through standard deviation is higher in rural than urban inflation. Besides, States with higher 
overall inflation also tend to exhibit a wider rural-to-urban inflation gap, with rural inflation

exceeding urban inflation. A scatter plot of overall inflation for different States against their 
rural-to-urban inflation ratio reveals a positive correlation. For instance, the difference between 
rural and urban inflation in Haryana was much wider compared with Goa, which had relatively 
lower inflation.

OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD
3.27.	The RBI and the IMF have projected that India's consumer price inflation will progressively 
align towards the inflation target in FY26. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external 
or policy shocks, the RBI9  expects headline inflation to be 4.5 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent 
9    Monetary Policy Report, April 2024, Page 7. https://tinyurl.com/39p6phfu

Prices and Inflation
99
in FY26. IMF10  has projected an inflation rate of 4.6 per cent in 2024 and 4.2 per cent in 2025 
for India.
3.28.	The World Bank11 expects that the global supply of commodities will increase, and so 
will their demand due to improved industrial activity and trade growth. It projects a 3 per 
cent decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4 per cent decrease in 2025, mainly 
driven by lower energy, food and fertiliser prices. The energy price index is expected to reduce 
due to significant declines in coal and natural gas prices this year. Fertiliser prices are likely 
to weaken but remain above 2015-2019 levels due to strong demand and export restrictions. 
Base metal prices are projected to rise, reflecting increased global industrial activity and clean 
energy production. In general, the current downward movement in the prices of commodities 
imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook.

3.29.	On balance, the short-term inflation outlook for India is benign. However, from the angle 
of long-term price stability, the following options may be worth exploring. 
●  The domestic consumption of edible oils has been increasing faster than production, leading 
to increased import dependence. To reverse this pattern and to stabilise domestic prices, 
it is important to make focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds such as 
sunflower and rapeseed & mustard, and explore the potential of non-conventional oils such 
as rice bran oil and corn oil. The possibility of expanding the scope of the National Mission 
on Edible Oils beyond palm oil to other major oilseeds is worth an examination.

●	
India faces a persistent deficit in pulses and consequent price pressures. Production of 
pulses is concentrated in a few states and districts in the country, and is vulnerable to biotic 
and abiotic stresses. More efforts are needed to expand the area under pulses, particularly 
lentils, tur, and urad, in more districts and rice-fallow areas. It is also worth considering 
promoting the summer cultivation of urad and moong in areas with assured irrigation 
facilities.
●	
There have been many efforts by the Government to improve the storage and processing 
facilities for vegetables. In view of the continuing seasonal surges in the prices of vegetables 
like tomato and onion, it is important to assess the progress in developing modern storage 
facilities conducive to such specific crops, and evaluate the viability of such facilities whose 
services have highly seasonal demand. 
●  FY24 witnessed swift and effective administrative action by the Government to deal with 
price flare-ups in specific items. This was based on daily monitoring of prices at more 
than 500 centres. Prospectively, an important factor that can improve the swiftness and 
effectiveness of such action is complete clarity on prices and their indices. On this front, it 
may be important to fine-tune and expedite the ongoing action in the following areas. 
	
ƛ	 The high-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by different 
departments may be linked in such a way that the build-up of prices at each stage from 
the farm gate to the final consumer is quantifiable and monitorable. 
	
ƛ	 The ongoing efforts to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be 
expedited to have a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation. Further, considering 
that the results of the household consumer expenditure survey, 2022-23 of MoSPI are 
available, it may be appropriate to expeditiously revise the consumer price index with 
fresh weights and item baskets.

EXTERNAL SECTOR: 
STABILITY AMID PLENTY
India’s external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds 
accompanied by sticky inflation. Though merchandise exports moderated owing to 
lower demand from major trading partners, services exports continued to perform 
well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 
billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped.
The moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports have improved 
India’s current account deficit (CAD). Amongst services exports, software/IT services 
have driven an increase in overall exports; at the same time, business services exports 
have also been rising, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability 
Centres (GCCs). 
India is moving up the global value chains (GVCs), with the share of GVC-related 
trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The 
improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC 
participation. Aided by government measures on trade facilitation and reduction in 
logistics cost, India’s rank in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index improved 
by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023 out of 139 countries.
India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 
44.1 billion, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, 
and increased investor confidence. Rising FPI inflows kept the Indian Rupee in a 
manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24. The Rupee emerged as the least 
volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies 
in FY24. The shock absorbers of India’s external sector - forex reserves, sustainable 
external debt indicators, and market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion 
the global headwinds.
In the future, the changing composition of India’s export basket, enhancement in 
trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety 
considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play 
a significant role in driving India’s rise as a global supplier of goods and services.

INTRODUCTION
4.1	
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has been buffeted by several shocks 
- the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developments in the Middle East and the Red Sea crisis, leading 
to supply dislocations in several commodities and a considerable rise in inflation in many 
countries. Moreover, citizens of about 64 countries (plus the European Union), about 49 per 
cent of the world population, will exercise their franchise in 2024. This adds to the policy 
uncertainty confronting the global economy, especially in the context of international trade 
and immigration policies. Foreign investments, which drive international trade and commerce, 
have slowed down recently due to these uncertainties, higher interest rates in the developed 
world, and the pursuit of active industrial policies by developed countries. For example, the 
Inflation Reduction Act of the United States of America not only incentivised investment capital 
to stay at home but also lured capital from elsewhere.1
4.2	
As per the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)2, global 
foreign direct investment (FDI) decreased marginally by 2 per cent to USD 1.3 trillion in 2023 
from USD 1.4 trillion in 2022. Global trade, too, has been on a slow path, with the value of 
world merchandise trade declining by 5 per cent in 2023. External debt as a percentage of GDP 
of Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) increased from 26.2 per cent in 2012 
to 29.8 per cent in 2023. After witnessing a deficit in their current account balance in 2022, 
Advanced Economies (AEs) saw a surplus in 2023. For EMDEs, the current account balance 
has been in surplus in 2022 and 2023, albeit a moderation from 1.5 per cent of the GDP in 2022 
to 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2023.3  
4.3	
Against this backdrop, the chapter deals with India’s performance on external sector-
related parameters. Section 1 discusses prevailing global trade dynamics and the impact of 
ongoing geopolitical headwinds on trade. Section 2 focuses on India’s international trade 
sector, presenting some specific case studies on industries that have shown remarkable export 
performances while also dwelling on the general trends. It also presents the outcomes of some 
of India's latest Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The section further presents some analytical 
understanding of the exposure of our exports to imports from various countries and the need

CHANGING GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS
4.4	
Trade is a key pillar of an economy, spurring investment, job creation, economic growth, 
and raising living standards. Global trade patterns are reconfiguring. In 2023, Mexico became 
the largest goods trade partner of the US, surpassing China and Canada, with a total trade of 
USD 798 billion.4 Vietnam’s trade with China and the US has recently seen an increase. US 
imports from Vietnam more than doubled from USD 46 billion in 2017 to USD 114 billion in 
2023. During the same time, Vietnam’s imports from China rose from USD 58 billion to USD 
111 billion.5 In another instance, European economies are shifting their energy imports from 
Russia to Norway and the US. EU’s pipeline gas imports from Russia declined from 150.2 billion 
cubic meters in 2021 to 42.9 billion cubic meters in 2023. During the same time, its pipeline 
gas imports from the US rose from 18.9 billion cubic meters to 56.2 billion cubic meters.6 
These shifts reflect the emergence of new practices in international trade such as ‘decoupling’, 
‘derisking’, ‘reshoring’, ‘nearshoring’, and ‘friend sharing’ and the growing narrative of de-
globalisation.7  
4.5	
However, there is an argument that while the growth of trade as a percentage of GDP 
has stalled since the global financial crisis, the slowdown of global trade seems a natural 
development following its earlier fast growth (Chart IV.2).8 The de-globalisation trends are 
highly heterogeneous across countries. While the US and China are gradually decreasing their 
reliance on global markets, this does not seem true for the rest of the world.9 Research by 
the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) shows that despite its policies, the US remains 
reliant on Chinese inputs. In fact, the rise in trade through Mexico and Vietnam is a result of 
Chinese firms re-routing their supply through these countries (or by locating themselves in 
these countries). Further, China’s overwhelming dominance in the supply of processed critical 
minerals and materials for energy transition renders a true decoupling between the two nations 
neither easy nor likely. 
4.6	
As can be seen in Chart IV.1, global trade volume contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2023 after 
recording a 3 per cent expansion in 2022 following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.10 
The value of world merchandise trade fell by 5 per cent in 2023, indicating the effect of lower 
prices. This decline was offset mainly by a substantial increase in trade in commercial services, 
which rose by 9 per cent to USD 7.5 billion in 2023. Commercial services trade was lifted by

7 	 As per the World Economic Forum, friend-shoring refers to rerouting supply chains to countries perceived as politically and 
economically safe or low-risk to avoid disruption to the flow of business. Nearshoring refers to a company relocating business 
operations to a nearby country, often with a shared border. Reshoring is when a business transfers operations back to its home 
country.

4.7	
The adverse trade environment in 2023 is expected to ease somewhat this year and next, 
boosting goods trade in 2024 and 2025.11 World merchandise trade volume is expected to grow 
at 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, as demand for traded goods 
rebounds. The evidence of a rebound in global trade in 2025 is visible in the latest report released 
by UNCTAD.12  As per the report, global trade trends turned positive in the first quarter of 
2024, with the value of trade in goods increasing by around 1 per cent quarter-over-quarter and 
services by about 1.5 per cent. The growth was primarily driven by increased exports from China 
(9 per cent), India (7 per cent) and the USA (3 per cent). However, geopolitical tensions and 
policy uncertainty could limit the scope of any trade rebound. While export growth is expected 
to improve in many economies as external demand for goods picks up, food and energy prices 
could again spike due to geopolitical events and climate disturbances. Further, restrictive trade 
practices increasingly adopted by many countries are leading to higher prices because supply 
chains have become increasingly complex.13  
4.8	
The resilience of global trade is being tested by disruptions on two of the world’s leading 
shipping routes, viz the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The Panama Canal handles 6 per 
cent of global trade and over 70 per cent of traffic destined for or originating from the US. It 
is presently operating at partial capacity due to freshwater shortages, with restrictions likely 
to remain in place for some time. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal handles about 12 per cent of 
global trade and about one-third of container shipping between Asia and Europe.14 The traffic

diversion from the Red Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope has added ten days to Asia-
Europe journeys while also increasing fuel costs. Although global shipping costs returned 
to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of last year, container shipping rates have risen again. 
Extended detours around the Cape of Good Hope have led to a significant surge in ocean freight 
rates, reaching up to USD 10,000 per 40-foot container. Moreover, the Suez Canal Authority 
has declared a 5-15 per cent hike in transit fees for ships passing through the Panama Canal.15
4.9	
Amidst these prevailing geopolitical dynamics, India is expected to benefit from its strong 
trade relations across countries, as the analysis in the subsequent sections shows. India has 
broad and diversified trade relationships with Asia, Europe, and the US. The following section 
discusses India’s trade performance.
INDIA’S TRADE: RESILIENCE AMIDST GLOBAL TURMOIL
4.10	 International trade has contributed to India’s economic growth. Over time, through 
concerted reforms and facilitative measures to enhance trade, there has been a significant 
increase in the share of trade (goods and services) in GDP. The trade openness indicator16, 
which rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, has contributed significantly to economic growth 
as it facilitated an efficient allocation of resources through comparative advantage. The share of 
trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3 per 
cent in FY05 to 40.8 in FY23. India’s trade has been catching up with global levels, as reflected 
in Chart IV.2 below.

outbreak of the global pandemic, which halted this trend. FY22 marked a significant turnaround. 
A similar trend has been observed in overall imports (merchandise and services). The positive 
momentum extended into FY23, with India’s overall exports crossing USD 776 billion. Overall 
imports also increased to USD 898 billion in FY23 compared to USD 760.1 billion in FY22. 
Despite persistent global challenges, overall exports in FY24 surpassed the FY23 record, growing 
by 0.23 per cent, and overall imports in FY24 declined by 4.9 per cent despite robust domestic 
demand. During the first two months of FY25, overall exports increased to USD 133.6 billion, 
compared to USD 122.4 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the same 
time period, overall imports also increased from USD 136.4 billion to USD 149.9 billion, leading 
to a widening of the overall trade deficit from USD 14 billion to USD 16.3 billion.

Merchandise exports
4.13	 Affected by ongoing geopolitical tensions, India’s merchandise exports witnessed 
contraction in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24. However, there is evidence of a trend reversal in H2 
of FY24, with merchandise exports registering positive growth. Box IV.1 discusses the sectors 
that have shown remarkable export performance in the past few years. With rising exports, 
imports also witnessed positive growth in H2 of FY24. However, despite registering positive 
growth in H2 FY24, merchandise exports and imports contracted in FY24 compared to FY23. 
The decline in merchandise exports was mainly on account of a slowdown in India’s major 
exporting partners (especially the EU, whose real GDP grew barely by 0.6 per cent in 2023, 
compared to 3.6 per cent growth in 2024), along with the lagged impact of monetary tightening 
carried out by many countries to control rising inflation. While the volume of imports did 
not decline in FY24, the overall value of merchandise imports declined due to a fall in global 
commodity prices. Owing to a larger decline in imports than exports, the merchandise trade 
deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 compared to USD 264.9 billion in the previous

resilience with a sustained uptick in the last few months, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2

4.15	 From FY23 to FY24, there appears to be a shift in the composition of exports across various 
classifications. Notably, the share of capital goods in merchandise exports rose substantially 
from 16.3 per cent in FY23 to 18.9 per cent in FY24. This increase suggests India’s improved 
supplies of machinery, equipment, and other durable goods used in production processes, 
reflecting potential expansions or upgrades in its industrial capacities. Conversely, the share 
of consumer goods in merchandise exports declined slightly from 48.9 per cent in FY23 to 
47.5 per cent in FY24, indicating a marginal dip in the export of finished products intended for 
direct consumption. The share of intermediate goods also declined from 30.2 per cent to 28.4 
per cent.
Box IV.1: Product specific success stories of boosting exports
A series of measures undertaken by the Government have shown a remarkable increase in 
product-specific exports. Some of the success stories are mentioned below: -
Toy Exports: India's toy industry has long faced challenges in the global trade landscape, 
consistently being a net importer of toys for many years. However, the industry’s exports 
experienced notable growth in 2023. As per the Directorate General of Commerce 
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) data, India’s toy exports have shown a rising trend, 
registering a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.9 per cent between FY13 and 
FY24.18 Rising exports, coupled with declining imports, transformed India from a deficit 
to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. For over a decade, India heavily relied on China for 
around 76 per cent of its toy imports. India’s import bill for toys from China dropped from 
USD 214 million in FY13 to USD 41.6 million in FY24, leading to a decline in China’s share 
in India’s toy imports from 94 per cent in FY13 to 64 per cent in FY24,19 indicating India’s 
competitiveness in the international toy market.

Economic Survey 2023-24
112
Over the period 2014 to 2020, focused efforts by the Government resulted in the number of 
manufacturing units doubling, dependence on imported inputs reducing from 33 per cent 
to 12 per cent, the gross sales value growing by a CAGR of 10 per cent, and an overall rise in 
labour productivity.20
The measures taken by the Government for the toy industry include the formulation of a 
comprehensive National Action Plan for Toys with 21 specific action points, an increase in 
basic customs duty on toys, sample testing of each import consignment by the Directorate 
General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to curb sub-standard imports, issuance of a Quality 
Control Order for toys, and support through cluster-based approaches. India’s emergence 
as a toy exporting nation can be further attributed to its integration into the global toy value 
chain and zero-duty market access for domestically manufactured toys in critical countries 
such as the UAE and Australia.21
Defence Exports: India’s defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore 
in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports.22 Between 2015 and 2019, 
India held the distinction of being the world's second-largest arms importer. The narrative, 
however, has changed. India has transitioned from an arms importer and found a place 
in the list of the top 25 arms exporter nations. The defence industry, including the private 
sector and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), has made tremendous efforts to 
achieve the highest-ever defence exports. In addition, there has been a rise in the number 
of export authorisations issued to the defence exporters. From 1,414 export authorisations 
in FY23, the number has increased to 1,507 in FY24. About 100 domestic companies are
exporting a wide range of defence products and equipment such as aircraft like Dornier-228, 
artillery guns, Brahmos Missiles, PINAKA rockets and launchers, radars, simulators, and 
armoured vehicles.

To give a push to defence exports, the Government has taken several policy initiatives over 
the past ten years. Export procedures have been simplified and made industry-friendly, 
with end-to-end online export authorisation curtailing delays and facilitating ease of 
doing business. Further, the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiatives have helped the country by 
encouraging indigenous design, development and manufacture of defence equipment, 
thereby reducing dependency on imports in the long run.
Footwear Exports: The Indian footwear and leather industry is an important foreign 
exchange earner. India is the second-largest global producer of footwear after China, 
accounting for 13 per cent of global footwear production and 2.2 per cent of global exports. 
India is the ninth-largest global footwear exporter.23 As per DGCIS, India’s footwear exports 
have increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24.24

The Government has undertaken various measures to boost footwear exports. These 
include the issuance of three Quality Control Orders for the footwear and leather sector 
after consultation with the Bureau of Indian Standards, relaxation in the creation of testing 
facilities by allowing outsourcing of the majority of the tests which are carried out less 
frequently, creating awareness amongst footwear manufacturers of footwear across India, 
among others. The Government has approved the continuation of the ‘Indian Footwear and 
Leather Development Programme’ till 31 March 2026. The leather and footwear sector can 
avail benefits of export promotion schemes under the Foreign Trade Policy 2023 and other 
benefits provided under the Market Access Initiatives Scheme, Trade Infrastructure for 
Export Schem, Interest Equalisation Scheme, etc.25  The Indian footwear market, valued at 
USD 26 billion, is expected to reach USD 90 billion by 2030. This growth will be driven by 
increased non-leather footwear demand and a possible shift in leather shoe production

from small-scale cottage industries to large corporates.26 Changing market dynamics, 
mainly fuelled by evolving shopping habits, rapid urbanisation, greater brand awareness, 
the development of retail precincts/malls, and rising discretionary budgets, are contributing 
to this trend.
Smartphone exports: India’s domestic production and exports of smartphones have 
been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved, especially since the launch of the 
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020. FY20 marked the first-time domestic 
production exceeded domestic demand, and smartphones became one of India's top export 
categories. Exports now provide the primary stimulus for the growth of the sector. A 42.2 
per cent increase in exports in FY24 (on a YoY basis) enabled smartphones to rank among 
India’s top five export items considered at six-digit HS product categories.27

India also became the world's sixth-largest smartphone exporter in 2022, from the 23rd-
largest smartphone exporter in 2014.28 This high export growth has led to an increase in the 
ratio of exports to production, with exports being above 31 per cent of the total output of 
smartphones in India in FY24.
4.16	 India is adding more export destinations, signalling regional diversification of exports. 
Calculations based on DGCIS data reveal that the share of the top 10 countries in India’s 
merchandise exports has registered a declining trend, falling from a high of 61.9 per cent in 
FY2000 to 50.5 per cent in FY24. Further, the Regional Herfindahl Index (an estimate of the 
concentration of exports across countries)29 for the top 10 countries declined from 0.071 in 
FY2000 to 0.046 in FY24.

4.17	 Post-FY2000, Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations, such as the UAE, Singapore, 
Hong Kong, and China, have emerged as export destinations, replacing traditional export 
partners like the UK, Germany, Belgium, etc. The combined share of the developing regions 
viz. Asia and Africa in India’s total exports rose from around 42.9 per cent in FY2000 to 52 per 
cent in FY24. In FY24, UAE, Singapore, China, Russia, and Australia emerged as India’s major 
export partners.
Sectoral trends
4.18	 A bifurcation of merchandise exports into POL and non-POL products shows that 
exports across both categories have declined in FY24. The fall in POL exports can be attributed 
mainly to a decline in global petroleum product prices. Even though the volume of POL exports 
increased from 99 million tonnes in FY23 to 108 million tonnes in FY24, the value of exports 
declined by 13.7 per cent, from USD 97.5 billion to USD 84.2 billion during the same period. 
However, in the last six years, POL exports increased by 80.8 per cent from USD 46.6 billion 
in FY19 to USD 84.2 billion in FY24, with the share in global POL exports (HS 2710 to 2713) 
exports rising from 4.3 per cent in 2018 to 4.8 per cent in 2022.30
4.19	 Under non-POL products, exports of engineering goods, electronic goods and drugs & 
pharmaceuticals increased in FY24 on a YoY basis. In contrast, agriculture and allied products, 
chemicals, plastics and textiles have witnessed a decline in exports. Over the past six years, 
the composition of exports across these categories has changed. Engineering goods dominated 
the merchandise exports in FY19, accounting for 25.3 per cent of the total exports. This trend 
remained the same, with engineering goods exports reaching USD 109.3 billion in FY24, with 
the share being the same at 25 per cent. Agri and allied products also maintained a steady

share. From USD 36.6 billion in FY19, their exports peaked at USD 52.7 billion in FY23 before 
slightly declining to USD 48.3 billion in FY24, holding around 11 per cent share in merchandise 
exports. Chemical and plastic exports experienced notable growth, rising from USD 31 billion 
in FY19 to USD 37.5 billion in FY24. Despite this increase in value, their share declined from 
9.4 per cent in FY19 to 8.6 per cent in FY24. The textile sector witnessed a relative decline in 
prominence. Along with a decline in their exports from USD 37.5 billion in FY19 to USD 34.8 
billion in FY24, their share in total exports also dropped significantly from 11.4 per cent to 8 
per cent during the same period. This reduction, apart from reflecting the shifting priorities 
and emerging sectors within India's export framework, is also likely reflective of underlying 
challenges in the sector that need addressing.
4.20	 India’s share in world electronics exports (captured by incorporating HS chapters 84, 85, 
and 90) has improved from 0.63 per cent in 2018 to 0.88 per cent in 202231. As such, India's 
rose from 28th in 2018 to 24th in 2022 in global electronics exports. The share of electronics 
goods in merchandise exports of India rose from 2.7 per cent in FY19 to 6.7 per cent in FY24. 
4.21	 India maintained a strong foothold in the drugs and pharmaceuticals sector. The share of 
the sector in India’s exports grew from 5.8 per cent in FY19 to 6.4 per cent in FY24, with exports 
rising from USD 19.1 billion in FY19 to USD 27.9 billion in FY24.
Merchandise imports
4.22	 Despite high domestic demand due to the relatively strong growth of India’s economy, 
merchandise imports contracted by 5.7 per cent in FY24, from USD 716 billion in FY23 to 
USD 675.4 billion in FY24. The moderation in merchandise imports was primarily driven by 
petroleum, crude and products, fertilisers, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, organic 
and inorganic chemicals, and textile yarn fabric, among others. Owing to a rise in domestic 
demand, merchandise imports rose from USD 106.5 billion during April-May 2023 to USD 116 
billion during April-May 2024. 
4.23	 Several important shifts in the composition of imports between FY23 and FY24 could be 
seen. Imports of capital goods saw an increase, which is welcome as it indicates a heightened 
demand for machinery, equipment, and other durable goods used in production processes, 
suggesting potential investments in industrial infrastructure or technological upgrades. A 
marginal uptick in the share of consumer goods in merchandise imports reflects a stable but 
limited increase in the importation of finished products for direct consumption. The share of 
intermediate goods in merchandise imports also slightly rose in FY24, reflecting a continued 
need for semi-finished products, components, or materials used in further manufacturing 
processes.

Services as a shining star in exports
4.24	 India’s services export in US Dollars terms expanded at a robust CAGR of more than 
14 per cent over the last 30 years (between 1993 and 2022), significantly higher than India’s 
merchandise export growth (10.7 per cent) and world services export growth (6.8 per cent). 
Accordingly, the share of India’s services exports in world services exports has risen remarkably 
from 0.5 per cent in 1993 to 4.3 per cent in 2022. India is now the seventh-largest services 
exporting country globally, with a phenomenal rise from its 24th position in 2001. India ranks 
2nd in the world in telecommunication, computer, and information services exports, 6th in 
personal, cultural and recreational services exports, 8th in other business services exports, 
10th in transport services exports, and 14th in travel services exports. As noted by the RBI, 
healthy and steady growth in services exports has imparted strength to India’s BoP position by 
offsetting a significant part of the country's merchandise trade deficit.33
4.25	 India’s deep integration into the value chains of the global software industry has led to 
a change in the composition of its services exports basket. While the early 2000s was a period 
of business process outsourcing (BPOs) that provided cost-cutting back-end IT services, India 
now looks beyond such services. Data from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) shows that 
India went from providing back-end services in law, IT, and management in 2010 to providing 
upstream and high-value-added services in these fields by 2020.34 The Russia-Ukraine conflict 
and global inflation pressured wages encouraged global players to look towards India to set up 
their back-office operations to balance their cost model. This gave rise to a sudden proliferation 
of the Global Capability Centres (GCCs). The growth in GCCs is reflected in the services BoP, 
with ‘Other Business Services’ being the second-largest contributor in services exports in FY24 
(26 per cent), after IT services (48 per cent). The rising contribution of other business services

to overall services exports is shown by their achieving a CAGR of 18 per cent between FY20 and 
FY24. The share of software exports in overall services exports declined from 50 per cent in 
FY21 to 48 per cent in FY24.35  Box IV.2 discusses the growth of GCCs in India in some detail.

Box IV.2: Journey of Global Capability Centres in India 
Origin of GCCs: In the last couple of years, more than 150 multinationals have set up their 
GCCs in India.36 Starting with the humble beginning of offshoring by Texas Instruments 
by setting up its office in Bengaluru in 1985, India has come a long way to being at the 
epicentre of GCC growth.37 In the 1990s, other companies followed suit, and many airlines 
and technology companies started their operations in India. These were called ‘captive 
centres’ earlier and have now come to be addressed as GICs (global in-house centres) or 
GCCs. In 2012, about 760 GCCs were operating out of India. In 2016, that number went over 
1000, and as of March 2023, India houses over 1,600 GCCs.
Various agencies have projected that the number of GCCs would grow in the coming years, 
creating jobs as well. According to a PwC report, by 2028, the country is poised to have 
2100 GCCs, with the market size of the centres touching USD 90 billion.38 As per a study 
by Wizmatic39, GCCs presently employ 32 lakh people, primarily engineers and scientists. 
They generated a combined revenue of USD 46 billion in 2023 and are estimated to generate 
a total revenue of USD 121 billion by 2030, roughly 3.5 per cent of India’s GDP. Out of this, 
USD 102 billion will represent export earnings.

Role of GCCs: GCCs provide bespoke services in operation, product development and 
innovation. Today, GCCs operate across all IT, BPO, engineering, and software product 
development service lines, delivering complex work that requires a significant understanding 
of business context and imperatives. They have made a mark in key industry verticals such 
as banking and financial services, software, telecom and semiconductors, with a growing 
concentration in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, healthcare and pharma.

Government support for GCCs: Strategic interventions under various initiatives like 
‘Digital India’ and policies for easing doing business have streamlined online approvals and 
licensing processes for GCCs. Initiatives like streamlined tax regulations and compliance 
procedures for foreign companies for setting up GCCs, flexible labour laws, and single-
window clearance systems for faster approvals have eased the business process. Improved 
digital infrastructure (high-speed internet, data centres) has been a boon for GCC operations.
Various States are undertaking a multi-pronged approach to boost the GCC ecosystem 
by identifying high-potential industries. For example, State Governments of Karnataka, 
Telangana and Tamil Nadu have launched research and development (R&D) policies to 
expand the GCC landscape in sectors such as auto and electric vehicles, electronics, pharma 
and life sciences in the states. These policies aim to develop innovation hubs in the States 
by leveraging the existing industry presence and the academic and R&D ecosystem. For 
instance, Telangana contributes to over 30 per cent of India’s pharma production and is 
home to more than 1,000 life sciences companies and over 200 FDA-approved sites for 
producing innovative and generic medicines.40 The Karnataka Digital Economy Mission
(KDEM)41 aims to increase the State’s contribution to India’s digital economy to USD 300 
billion by 2026 by enabling holistic growth of the tech sectors and start-ups by deepening 
partnerships with industry players and developing tech clusters beyond the State’s capital 
to achieve higher contribution. Consequently, leading technology companies have started 
operations in Mysuru, Mangalore and Hubballi clusters, generating employment for more 
than 5,000 people.
Partnership with Startups to support global technology needs: As per a 
NASSCOM report, GCCs are leveraging India’s vital engineering research and development 
service provider community, its mature start-ups, and its peer-GCC ecosystem. They have 
established more than 15 incubators, over 40 accelerators, and multiple partner programmes 
to drive collaboration with Indian start-ups.42 Healthcare and pharma GCCs have witnessed 
an increased partnership with start-ups and academia to access newer technology. The 
GCCs have explored various forms of collaboration, such as innovation labs, hackathons 
and start-up incubators.
Expansion to Tier-II cities: GCCs are increasingly evaluating tier-II towns to expand 
their operations, influenced by the reverse migration seen during the pandemic and the 
cost arbitrage offered by such relatively under-penetrated markets. The recent thrust on 
infrastructure development in these cities has also added to their appeal. As per a CBRE 
research report, 43, during H1 of 2023, about 22 per cent of GCC centres were set up in tier-II 
cities, driven by the availability of existing and fresh talent.

Rising global demand for India: While US and Europe-based MNCs have been 
establishing their capability centres for a long time, international players from the Asia 
Pacific region, especially Japan and South Korea, have begun setting up their R&D/
innovation centres in India over the past few years. Although other countries with GCC 
presence have emerged recently, India remains a GCC favourite in a highly competitive 
global environment due to its ample talent endowment and cost advantage.
The way forward: Today, GCCs contribute to their parent organisations’ success and 
propel India’s economic growth. They account for more than 1 per cent of the country’s GDP, 
and the share is expected to grow further.44 As more global players eye India to set up their 
GCC operations, the government has a crucial role in facilitating their entry. Government 
support for identifying new business models for partnerships, simplifying the entry process, 
and emphasising trust and data security, among others, will further encourage the location 
of GCCs in India.
India’s rising Global Value Chains (GVC) participation
4.26	 GVCs refer to international production sharing, where operations are spread across 
national borders (instead of being confined to the exact location), producing a complex product. 
In what has come to be called a period of ‘hyperglobalisation’45, the early 2000s saw rapid GVC 
expansion worldwide. This led to exponential gains in trade, reductions in supply chain costs 
and deep interlinkages in trade across nations. A dramatic shift from “hyperglobalisation” to 
“slowbalisation”46  occurred following the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). Concerns about 
the risks and uncertainties surrounding GVCs were further amplified with shocks such as the 
China-USA trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. More recently, 
this trend has begun to see a reversal. WTO’s GVC Development Report 202347 showcases 
recovery in GVCs, underscored by a rise in the share of foreign export inputs and enhanced 
participation rates of economies worldwide. 
4.27	 In line with the global trend, India’s GVC participation rose steadily through the 1990s 
and 2000s before the GFC, after which it started declining. For instance, the foreign value-
added content of India’s exports rose from 10 per cent in 1995 to 22 per cent in 2009 (the second 
highest amongst BRICS nations, after China), reflecting increased fragmentation of production 
and integration into GVCs.48 After the lull seen in the years succeeding the global financial crisis, 
India’s GVC participation has begun to rev up again on the back of incentives provided through 
schemes such as the PLI and Districts as Exports Hub (DEH) initiative. Box IV.3 discusses

in detail the trend in India’s GVC participation and change in sectoral composition. Box IV.4 
highlights the success stories of DEH. 
4.28	 The evidence of India’s enhanced global supply chain participation is reflected in increased 
investment by foreign firms in electronics, apparel and toys, automobiles and components, 
capital goods and semiconductor manufacturing in India. India’s large domestic consumer 
market is an added attraction for firms setting up shop here. For example, Apple assembled 14 
per cent of its global iPhones in India in FY24. Foxconn invested in the states of Karnataka and 
Tamil Nadu to set up new manufacturing plants for components. 
4.29	 Asia is the primary beneficiary of shifting supply chains. India has received the most 
interest from firms (28 out of 130 firms) regarding setting up or expanding production facilities, 
followed by Vietnam, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.49
Box IV.3: The trend in India’s GVC participation and change in the sectoral  
composition
The WTO’s World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) database shows that India’s GVC-
related trade50 increased nearly four times from USD 62.9 billion in 2010 to USD 233.1 
billion in 2022. Essential products driving India's GVC participation include coal and 
petroleum, business services, chemicals, and transport equipment. India’s GVC trade grew 
at a CAGR of 14.6 per cent between 2018 and 2022. This is higher than the CAGR of 13.3 per 
cent between 2014 and 2018 and 6.9 per cent between 2010 and 2014.

Over the years, the sectoral composition of India’s GVC-related trade has changed markedly. 
Within the manufacturing sector, the share of low-technology manufacturing52  has declined 
over the years, while the share of medium53 and high-technology manufacturing54 has been 
rising. The increase in medium technology manufacturing can also be seen in the shift toward 
industries such as coke and petroleum, transport equipment and primary and fabricated 
metals, which have a significant share in India’s GVC-related trade.

outsourcing (BPO) services to high-value-added services, such as those provided by global 
capability centres (GCCs).
Previously, India’s GVCs involved a higher level of forward participation, which resulted 
in lower value-addition for exports within the country. However, in recent years, India has 
begun to move downstream and export finished goods to the rest of the world.55 This can 
be seen in the rise in the share of pure backward GVC participation from 13.8 per cent in 
2019 to 16.3 per cent in 2022. Sectors such as food and beverages, electrical and optical 
equipment, and financial intermediation, among others, have witnessed a remarkable 
increase in backward GVC participation. Even by stricter estimation, i.e., excluding coke, 
refined petroleum and nuclear fuel, the share of pure backward participation in gross trade 
increased from 12.1 per cent in 2019 to 14 per cent in 2022. In contrast, the share of pure 
forward GVC participation (or upstream participation) in trade has declined from 19.1 per 
cent in 2016 to 17.6 per cent in 2022 in sectors such as retail trade, coke, refined and nuclear 
fuel, chemicals and primary and fabricated metals, among others.
Rising backward GVC participation bodes well for India. The latest research by Professor 
Veeramani and Dhir56 shows that greater backward GVC participation results in higher 
absolute levels of gross exports, domestic value-added, and employment.

Despite so much progress, India’s GVC participation (GVC-related trade as per cent of gross 
trade at 40.3 per cent in 2022) is still lower not only in comparison to large economies such 
as the USA (43.7 per cent), UK (47.8 per cent) and Japan (46.6 per cent), but also its Asian 
counterparts, such as South Korea (56.2 per cent) and Malaysia (60 per cent). To further embrace

GVCs and enhance participation, there is a need to develop quality trade infrastructure, 
integrate micro, small and medium enterprises in the GVC network, simplify procedures for 
entry and exit of small businesses, and work towards trade facilitation measures.
Finally, it is worth noting that India’s GVC expansion is taking place in an era that is 
not particularly conducive to GVCs. Countries worldwide are embracing mercantilism. 
Nonetheless, despite the rise in mercantilism, there is scope for collective country blocs to 
trade intensively with one another.  In this context, GVCs can help build self-reliance and 
promote shared trade gains amongst these country blocs.  
Box IV.4: Indian Districts as Export Hubs
Each district in the country holds economic potential comparable to that of a small country. 
They can become export hubs using their unique identities and prospects in the global 
marketplace. To take this forward, the Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) initiative was launched 
in August 2019 to foster balanced regional development across all districts of the country. The 
objective was to select, brand, and promote the sale of products from each district in the
domestic and international markets. Through the DEH initiative, the Government aims to 
boost manufacturing and exports from urban areas while focusing on generating interest 
and economic activity in the rural hinterland. India’s Foreign Trade Policy 2023 reiterated 
the role of DEH in India’s export efforts.
As part of its recent initiative under DEH - Focus @ 75 initiative, the Government has 
identified 75 districts across India to provide targeted support for boosting exports. Key 
events include Vanijya Saptah, a series of workshops aimed at educating and empowering 
local exporters, and participation in the Dubai Expo 2020, where Indian products were 
showcased to a global audience. A notable success of the expo is the introduction of Ladakh's 
apricots to Dubai supermarkets. Additionally, the Marine Buyer-Seller Meet connected 
Indian marine product exporters with international buyers, while marketing and branding 
workshops helped exporters enhance their product presentation.
The DEH initiative provides a broad base to promote financial inclusion and facilitate 
logistical and infrastructural support to engage all districts of the country in developing 
at least a commodity for the global market and thus promoting exports. The bottom-up 
approach helps India establish a direct link between production units and meet national 
export obligations.
All States/UTs have established an institutional mechanism by constituting State Export 
Promotion Committees (SEPC) and District Export Promotion Committees (DEPC). District 
Export Action Plans have been prepared and updated from time to time by the DEPCs to 
identify bottlenecks and necessary interventions to support exporters and manufacturers 
in promoting the export of identified products/services. So far, 567 Districts have prepared

Economic Survey 2023-24
126
their Export Action Plans (DEAPs). Districts have identified 304 unique products spanning 
across 13 sectors across the country. Notably, 14 out of these 304 unique products have been 
identified as services strategically distributed across over 100 districts.
The Government is also promoting e-commerce exports through its DEH initiative, 
collaborating with relevant e-commerce partners, Export Promotion Councils, and relevant 
Government departments. The initiative focuses on educating MSMEs about e-commerce 
exports, enabling them to sell globally, and includes training and handholding on imaging 
and digital cataloguing of products. As a result of these collaborations, 10 outreach events 
were organised in Districts export outreach events in Faridabad, Moradabad, Ludhiana, 
Jodhpur, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Jamshedpur, and Varanasi during 
the first quarter of 2024. These events, organised with leading e-commerce partners, 
provided valuable hand-holding, capacity-building, and training sessions for participating 
businesses, offering key insights and support to help them succeed in global markets.
The Government is taking further steps to enhance the performance of the scheme. For 
instance, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has partnered with Exim Bank 
to boost exports under the ODOP (One District, One Product) and DEH initiative. This
collaboration stems from an Exim Bank study that identified 59 middle export districts with 
export potential. Under the collaboration, the DGFT will be working with Exim Bank in 20 
districts. These districts will receive support through Exim Bank's GRID program (Grassroots 
Initiatives for Development). The program aims to address sector-specific challenges and 
identify suitable beneficiaries for support. Exim Bank aims to prepare a detailed proposal 
outlining challenges and solutions for collaborative implementation.
Changing landscape of India’s global trade arrangements
4.30	 Global economic growth and international trade are passing through a particularly 
challenging phase of uncertainty, as detailed in paras 4.4 to 4.8 above.  In this context, open, 
inclusive, predictable, non-discriminatory, and mutually beneficial trade can provide an impetus 
to economic growth. India advocates for a rule-based international trading system with these 
attributes with WTO at its core. In this spirit, India considers Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) an 
instrument of trade liberalisation and a complement to the multilateral trading system under 
WTO. Accordingly, the country has engaged with its trading partners/blocs to expand its export 
markets while ensuring better terms for essential imports to meet domestic demand in a cost-
competitive manner. 
4.31	 After a gap of nearly 10 years, four new FTAs have been signed over the period 2021 to 
2024.57 These FTAs are with Mauritius (signed in February 2021), the UAE (February 2022), 
Australia (April 2022) and the European Free Trade Association or EFTA (March 2024). All 
57  Before 2021, the last FTA signed was with Japan in February 2011, which came into force in August 2011.

127
these FTAs have come into force except the last one. Having signed FTAs with most East-
Asian partners, these new trade engagements focus on gaining access to the Western and 
African markets, as well as potential partners having trade complementarity. India’s young 
demography and growing middle-class population provide an attractive market for its Western 
FTA partners.
4.32	 One of the major criteria for engaging with an FTA partner is to ensure that the trading 
partner is a natural partner in terms of trade complementarity. Academic literature on natural 
trading partners identifies factors that would promote robust trade between FTA partners and 
facilitate deeper economic integration. The initial trade volume, geographic proximity, and 
trade complementarity are prominent among them.58
India-Mauritius CECPA
4.33	 Since 2005, India has been among the largest trading partners of Mauritius. India’s 
exports to Mauritius stood at USD 462.7 million in FY23, while Mauritius’s exports to India 
were USD 91.8 million, taking the total trade to USD 554.5 million. Trade has grown by 168 per 
cent in the last 17 years, from FY06 to FY23. Petroleum products were the largest export item 
for India between 2007 and 2019 until the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited 
supply contract was terminated in mid-2019. Other Indian exports to Mauritius include 
pharmaceuticals, cereals, cotton, shrimps, prawns and bovine meat. Main Mauritian exports 
to India are vanilla, medical devices, needles, aluminium alloys, scrap paper, refined copper, 
men's cotton shirts, etc.59
4.34	 India and Mauritius signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership 
Agreement (CECPA) in February 2021. The CECPA is the first trade Agreement signed by India 
with an African country. The agreement covers trade in goods, rules of origin, trade in services, 
Technical Barriers to Trade, Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, etc. The Agreement covers 
310 export items for India, including foodstuffs and beverages, agricultural products, etc. 
Mauritius benefits from preferential market access to India for its products such as frozen fish, 
speciality sugar, biscuits, fresh fruits, juices, mineral water, etc.
4.35	 As regards trade in services, Indian service providers have access to around 115 sub-
sectors from the 11 broad service sectors such as professional services, computer-related 
services, research & development, other business services, telecommunication, construction, 
distribution, education, environmental, financial, tourism & travel related, recreational, yoga, 
audio-visual services, and transport services. India has offered trade access to around 95 sub-
sectors from 11 broad services sectors, including professional services, R&D, other business 
services, telecommunication, financial, distribution, higher education, environmental, health, 
tourism and travel-related, recreational, and transport services.60

India-UAE CEPA
4.36	 The UAE can be classified as a natural trading partner, having been featured among India’s 
top three trade partners for the past two decades. UAE has been India’s largest export market 
for gems and jewellery, cereal, and fuel. Through the UAE CEPA (Comprehensive Economic 
Partnership Agreement), these labour-intensive products will receive preferential access.61
4.37	 The bilateral trade between India and the UAE in FY24 was USD 83.7 billion. The UAE 
is India’s second-largest export destination, with approximately USD 35.6 billion in exports 
in FY24. The UAE is also the eighth largest investor in India, with an estimated investment 
of USD 18 billion, whereas Indian investments in the UAE are estimated at around USD 85 
billion62. The CEPA is expected to increase the bilateral trade in goods to USD 100 billion within 
five years of the signing and increase trade in services to USD 15 billion. The India-UAE CEPA 
is likely to benefit about USD 26 billion worth of Indian products that are subjected to 5 per 
cent import duty by the UAE. UAE can also become a hub for sourcing India’s capital goods 
and intermediates for further value-added exports to other African and European destinations. 
Also, for the first time in any Trade Agreement, a separate Annex on pharmaceuticals has 
been incorporated to facilitate access to Indian pharmaceutical products, especially automatic 
registration and marketing authorisation in 90 days for products approved by developed 
country regulators, namely the United States (USFDA), the United Kingdom (UKMHRA), the 
European Union (EMA), and Japan (PMDA).
4.38	 Further, India has included digital trade within the ambit of its FTA with UAE for the 
first time, which will help leverage India’s advantage in digital payment and e-commerce 
services. The agreement also involves government procurement and data usage provisions, 
while completely safeguarding the provisions of General Financial Rules and the Orders issued 
thereunder, including Preference for ‘Make in India’ Order and MSME Preference policies.
India-Australia ECTA
4.39	 Unlike UAE, Australia did not have as large an initial trade volume with India. Even so, 
Australia's trade basket with India has a substantial complementarity, thus classifying it as a 
natural trading partner.63 India imports resources and primary products from Australia and 
exports finished goods.
4.40	 Australia was India’s 13th largest trading partner in FY24, and India was Australia’s 5th 
largest trading partner in 2023. India-Australia bilateral merchandise trade increased from 
USD 25 billion in FY22 to USD 26 billion in FY23. The India-Australia Economic Cooperation

and Trade Agreement (ECTA) estimated bilateral trade in goods and services for both countries 
to rise from USD 27.5 billion in 2021 to USD 45 billion in 5 years.64
4.41	 The Agreement is likely to benefit various labour-intensive sectors of India, which 
were otherwise subjected to Australia's 5 per cent import duty on the majority of products 
earlier. It will result in immediate market access at zero duty to 98.3 per cent of tariff lines 
accounting for 96.4 per cent of India’s exports to Australia in value terms. India is Australia's 
third largest services export market. Regarding market access to services, Australia has offered 
135 sub-sectors to India, and India has offered 103 sub-sectors to Australia. The Agreement 
opens avenues for investment in computer-related services, telecom, construction, health & 
environmental services.65
India-EFTA TEPA
4.42	 The thrust of the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) 
is deeper economic engagement with the EFTA countries- Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, 
and Liechtenstein. This is the first FTA of India with any European country. The successful 
conclusion of an FTA with this set of developed countries, is a significant positive signal to 
the world, showcasing India’s firm commitment to trade liberalisation at a time of rising 
protectionism across both developed and developing countries. It is an innovative and well-
balanced pact that covers two-way trade in goods and services as well as bilateral investments. 
4.43	 Further, India is also presently engaged in FTA negotiations with some of its trading partners; 
notable among these FTA negotiations are – (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-EU FTA, (iii) India-
Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), building on Ind-Aus ECTA, 
(iv) India-Peru Trade Agreement, covering goods, services, and investment, (v) India-Eurasian 
Economic Union (India-EAEU) FTA and (vi) India-Sri Lanka Economic and Technical Cooperation 
Agreement (ECTA).  The Government reviews FTAs based on extensive inter-ministerial and 
industry consultations. Accordingly, reviews of its existing FTAs, namely, the India-South Korea 
CEPA and the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), have been initiated.
Government initiatives on trade facilitation measures and reduction 
in logistics cost
4.44	 The Government has undertaken various measures to enhance production capacity, 
promote exports and reduce logistics costs involved in international trade. These include 
setting export targets and monitoring these targets followed by course correction, provision 
of export credit insurance services for short-term as well as medium and long-term exports, 
and encouraging banks to provide affordable and adequate export credit to micro, small and 
medium enterprises (MSME) exporters, enabling them to explore new markets and diversify

existing products competitively, among others. The Government has also streamlined trade 
processes, enhancing transparency and promoting cooperation among stakeholders through 
initiatives such as Turant,66 Customs,67 Single Window Interface for Facilitation of Trade 
(SWIFT),68 pre-arrival data processing, e-Sanchit,69 Coordinated Border Management, etc. 
4.45	 The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has undertaken various 
technological initiatives to facilitate trade. These include the phased implementation of an 
electronic cash ledger,70 enabling electronic clearances at Land Customs Stations, online 
submission of IFSC Code, use of Electronic Certificates of Origin, and Electronic Repairs 
Services Outsourcing to prolong the life of faulty or damaged electronic goods, among others. 
Department of Posts (DoP) has developed a Postal Bill of Export Automation System for the 
electronic filing and processing of PBE, under which an exporter is not required to visit a 
Foreign Post Office and present an export parcel. In a transformative partnership, the CBIC 
and the DoP launched the Hub and Spoke Model, simplifying the export process, promoting 
small-scale exporters, and leveraging India’s extensive global trade postal network. This scheme 
harnesses the vast postal network of 1.54 lakh post offices, using digital technology and apps, 
and eliminates intermediaries for seamless exports via postal services.
4.46	 To boost efficiency and lower logistics costs, the Government launched the PM GatiShakti 
National Master Plan and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) in October 2021 and September 
2022, respectively. Digital reforms, such as the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP)71 
and the Logistics Data Bank,72 are additional measures taken towards improving logistics. 
Initiatives, such as railway track electrification, reduced release times by the Land Ports 
Authority of India (LPAI), and the launch of NLP Marine for port-related logistics were also 
undertaken. Since the launch of the NLP, over 614 industry players have registered on ULIP, 
106 private companies have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), 142 companies have 
submitted 382 use cases to be hosted on ULIP and 57 applications have been made live as of 
September 2023.73
4.47	 As a result of these initiatives, there has been an improvement in India’s performance 
in the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Paciﬁc's (UNESCAP) Global

Transparency, Formalities, Institutional Arrangement and Cooperation, and Paperless Trade. 
Further, the country has witnessed a substantial improvement in the score for “Women in 
Trade Facilitation” component from 66.7 per cent in 2021 to 77.8 per cent in 2023, indicating a 
commitment to gender inclusivity and women's empowerment in the trade sector.
4.48	 Another evidence of the success of trade facilitation measures is reflected in the 
National Time Release Study (2023)75 conducted by the CBIC. The study shows that the overall 
average import release time76  has improved by 20 per cent in 2023 over 2022. The maximum 
improvement in the average release time was reported by Mundra (33 per cent) among seaports, 
Hyderabad (44 per cent) among Air Cargo Complexes (ACCs), and Tughlakabad (23 per cent) 
among Inland Container Depots. 
4.49	 The reduction in logistics cost is reflected in an improvement in India’s rank on the World 
Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI),77 which improved by six places to 38th in 2023 from 
44th in 2018 out of 139 countries. With the introduction of cargo tracking, dwell time78 in the 
eastern port of Visakhapatnam fell from 32.4 days in 2015 to 5.3 days in 2019. Additionally, 
India’s position in international shipments climbed to 22 in 2023 from 44 in 2018 due to its 
modernisation and digitalisation efforts. India moved up five places in infrastructure score and 
four places up to 48th in logistics competence and equality. The Government aspires to secure 
a position within the top 25 countries on the index, which comprises 139 countries, by 2030.79

4.51	 The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has played a remarkable role in reducing logistics 
costs. The ‘One Nation, One Tax’ regime has ensured that trucks do not have to wait for hours 
on state borders, which has reduced travel time by up to 30 per cent. This has reduced the 
logistics cost and increased the average distance trucks travel from 225 km before GST to 300-
325 km, as per a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report.83 This has been a great 
value, adding to the ease of doing business and the growth of manufacturing in the country. An 
NCAER study of December 2023 has shown that the logistics cost in the economy has declined 
by 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points of GDP between FY14 and FY22.84
4.52	 The improvement in India’s logistics performance is also reflected at the State level. The 
2023 Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) highlights a positive shift in stakeholders' 
perception across all three pillars of logistics performance services, infrastructure and 
regulatory environment in 2023 over 2019, empowering State Governments by providing 
region-specific insights for informed decision-making and comprehensive growth.85 A positive 
shift in stakeholder perception is attributed to multiple reform measures initiated by States and 
UTs over the past couple of years to improve their logistics eco-system, including formulation 
of logistics policy, development of supporting infrastructure and enhancing regulatory ease.

FAVOURABLE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE
4.53	 The current account is a record of a country's international transactions with the rest of 
the world. Trade is the dominant component of India’s current account. As discussed in para 
4.13, the narrowing of the overall trade deficit and increasing remittances (refer to para 4.54 
below) contributed to an improvement in the CAD in FY24. India’s CAD narrowed to USD 
23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the 
previous year. The improvement in CAD in FY24 is supported by the surplus in CAD recorded 
in Q4 of FY24 on the grounds of a decline in merchandise trade deficit, rising net services 
exports and increasing remittances. An analysis of India's CAD in relation to other nations 
reveals that India's CAD is relatively low (Chart IV. 21)

4.54	 Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion 
in FY24, primarily on account of rising exports of software, travel and business services. 
Similarly, the net private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians 
employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against their level of USD 101.8 billion 
during the previous year. Net services exports and remittances contributed to the surplus on 
the invisible account, which cushioned the merchandise trade deficit.
4.55	 Remittances are the second largest source of external financing after service exports, 
which contributes to narrowing the CAD and has always been a stable constituent of the 
BoP. According to the World Bank, India has the largest emigrant population and is the top 
remittance recipient country, with remittances reaching a milestone of USD 120 billion in 
2023.86 The increase in remittances was driven mainly by declining inflation and strong labour 
markets in the United States and Europe, the largest destination for India’s skilled migrants, 
and other OECD destinations, as well as positive demand for skilled and less-skilled workers in 
the GCC countries (which, together, are the second largest destination for Indian migrants).

use of Dirhams and Rupees for cross-border transactions. Remittances to India are forecasted 
to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 
2025. India’s share in South Asian remittances increased to 64.5 per cent in 2023 from 63 per

4.57	 Remittances differ from FDI, which companies disinvest during financial uncertainties. 
In times of economic downturn, FDI is considered pro-cyclical and destabilising. Remittances 
are a stable source of finance that will remain in the economy and are directly used by recipients, 
contributing to the nation's growth. From a BoP perspective, remittances are permanent foreign 
currency inflows and help finance merchandise trade deficits, contributing to the narrowing of 
the CAD. For net importers such as India, higher remittances partially offset the goods trade 
deficit and stabilise the CAD.

Box IV.5: Factors influencing inward remittances
The robust recovery of job markets in the high-income countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) following the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic has been the key driver of remittances, particularly as employment growth during 
the recovery was more rapid for immigrants than for the native-born. However, the remittance 
growth was 7.5 per cent in 2023 compared to a historic peak of 24.4 per cent in 2022. 
Some key factors influencing the extent of inward remittances to India are discussed below.
Remittances and oil prices: India meets a large part of its crude oil demand from imports, 
and a rise in global oil prices is a negative shock to the economy as it leads to a widening 
of CAD, an increase in inflation, and a weaker rupee. As reported in the Monetary Policy 
Report (October 2018), “it is estimated that for every USD 1 increase in the price of a barrel 
of crude, India’s current account deficit could widen by USD 0.8 billion”. However, the rise 
in global oil prices generally positively impacts the remittances received by the country, as

Economic Survey 2023-24
136
India's primary source of remittances is oil-exporting countries. An analysis of quarterly 
data on remittances and oil prices shows that there exists a positive correlation of 75.4 per 
cent between the two for India.
Chart IV.24 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of rise in oil prices are associated 
with higher remittances. 
The plausible mechanism is as follows: an increase in oil prices (positive shocks) can 
generate a sizable amount of oil revenues, leading to higher investments and growth in oil-
producing countries. As a result, the demand for migrant workers increases, translating into 
higher remittance outflows.88 On the other hand, persistently low oil prices (adverse shocks) 
can hamper economic activities in oil-exporting economies by decreasing oil revenues. 
Correspondingly, the demand for migrant workers decreases, which in turn can reduce 
remittance outflows to migrant worker countries.

Remittances and exchange rate: A higher CAD results in an increase in the demand for 
foreign currency and an increase in the supply of domestic currency as firms and consumers 
buy more imports. This applies downward pressure to the exchange rate. On the other hand, 
remitters get better value in rupee terms when it depreciates in terms of foreign currencies, 
be it for UAE’s Dirham, the US Dollar, the British Pound, or any other currency.
For every one USD a worker earns in distant lands, he returns an augmented amount after 
necessarily being converted according to the foreign land he works in. Hence, remittances 
exhibited a positive association with the exchange rate movement. An analysis of quarterly

data on remittances and exchange rate shows that there exists a positive correlation of 91 
per cent for India. Chart IV.25 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of exchange

Outlook: The outlook for remittance in India for 2024 is strong, with the expectation that 
remittance growth will moderate to 3.7 per cent, taking remittance levels to USD 124 billion 
in 2024. The diversification of India’s migrant pool between a large share of highly skilled 
migrants employed mostly in high-income OECD markets, and the less-skilled migrants 
employed in the GCC markets is likely to lend stability to migrants’ remittances in the event 
of external shocks. India’s efforts to link its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with source 
countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore are expected to reduce costs and 
speed up remittances.89 
CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCE
4.58	 Stable capital inflows continue to finance the CAD. During FY24, net capital flows stood 
at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI 
flows and net inflows of banking capital (including NRI deposits).	
4.59	 The net FPI flows saw a significant turnaround in FY24. Supported by optimism 
surrounding India’s growth story, progressive policy reform, economic stability, fiscal prudence 
and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust FPI inflows in FY24. Net FPI inflows 
stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. This 
is the highest level of FPI inflow after FY15. India received the highest equity inflows among

emerging market peers during FY24. Financial services, automobile and auto components, 
healthcare, and capital goods were the significant sectors attracting equity inflows during 
FY24. The recent inclusion of India’s Sovereign Bonds in the JP Morgan Government Bond 
Index-Emerging Markets90 is expected to contribute to higher debt inflows going forward and 
will likely spur demand for further exposure to India.

4.60	 The UNCTAD World Investment Report 202491 highlights that global FDI declined 
marginally by 2 per cent to USD 1.3 trillion in 2023 from USD 1.4 trillion in 2022. Weakening 
growth prospects, economic fracturing trends, trade and geopolitical tensions, industrial 
policies and supply chain diversification are reshaping FDI patterns, causing some multinational 
enterprises (MNEs) to adopt a cautious approach to overseas expansion. International project 
finance and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) were especially weak in 2023. M&As, 
which mostly affect FDI in developed countries, fell by 46 per cent in value. Project finance, 
important for infrastructure investment, was down 26 per cent. Tighter financing conditions, 
investor uncertainty, volatility in financial markets and tighter regulatory scrutiny were the 
principal causes of the decline. However, Greenfield investment project announcements 
provided a bright spot, with the number of projects increasing by 2 per cent, with the growth 
concentrated in manufacturing.

4.61	 The decline in global FDI flows has also impacted FDI flows to India. Net FDI inflows93 
to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, 
gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under 
USD 71 billion in FY24. In other words, there was no change in investor interest in India. The 
contraction in net inflows was primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment due to 
many profitable exits. A market that allows investors to take profits and exit their investments 
is a healthy one. That is why the repatriation of investment increased from USD 29.3 billion in 
FY23 to USD 44.5 billion in FY24. The decline in FDI inflows in recent years is also attributable 
to higher interest rates in developed countries and attractive exits out of India due to the 
buoyant stock market. 
An examination of change in trend and composition of FDI flows
FDI in the industry vs services sector
4.62	 A close examination of the FDI equity inflows into major sectors reveals that FDI inflow 
into the industry and services sectors94 has weakened in recent years. In fact, for both these 
sectors, the FDI-to-GDP ratio has dipped below pre-pandemic levels. The share of industry 
sectors' FDI in GDP declined from 0.62 per cent in FY20 to 0.39 per cent in FY24. During the 
same period, the share of the services sector in GDP fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.69 per cent.

Physical FDI vs Digital FDI
4.63	 FDI inflows can be divided into physical and digital for further analysis.  Physical FDI 
includes sectors such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and construction, while digital FDI 
includes computer services, telecommunications, consultancy services, and information and 
broadcasting.95 A few years ago (FY14), physical FDI was about three times the value of digital 
FDI. Owing to a rise in foreign investment in sectors such as software and hardware, consultancy 
services, and telecommunications, among others, digital FDI witnessed an increase, coupled 
with a relative decline in physical FDI.
4.64	 Nomura’s Global Market Research May 2024, ‘Asia’s New Flying Geese’, highlights that 
rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions have triggered the stagnation of physical FDI. One 
factor exacerbating this trend is the growing prevalence of non-equity modes of international 
production, such as contract manufacturing, third-party outsourcing or franchising. Under 
these scenarios, while economies may become more integrated into GVCs, this may not be 
reflected in the FDI data. During the pandemic, there was a surge in the share of digital services 
in total FDI owing to the prevalence of work-from-home culture and the availability of efficient 
digital infrastructure. As a result, the share of digital FDI in total FDI rose from 46.6 per cent 
in FY17 to 69.2 per cent in FY21. However, both digital and physical FDI have been falling in 
recent times. The fall in digital FDI has much to do with tech start-ups. Following a big increase 
during the pandemic, global flows into tech start-ups have fallen, a global trend in flows that is 
mirrored in India as well.

Actual FDI vs intentions
4.65	 The declining FDI flows to India are at odds with India gaining market share in global 
trade in goods and services exports. In this context, an exercise was undertaken to understand 
the relationship between FDI inflows and investment intentions. Two data sources have been 
used to estimate intentions. One is the UNCTAD data on announced greenfield FDI projects; 
the other is CMIE’s announced foreign private sector projects.96

96  The UNCTAD data only refers to greenfield investments, while the CMIE database includes different sectors. UNCTAD records 
data when there is a clear indication that jobs and new capex will be created, while CMIE includes projects even before essential 
licenses or land has been obtained/acquired or the funding has been tied up.

4.66	 Over time, there has been a significant change in the trend in investment intentions 
across sectors. While investment intentions in industries such as computers and chemicals 
have softened, investment intentions in new and futuristic sectors are increasing.97 In recent 
quarters, investment intentions in new and futuristic sectors, such as renewables, artificial 
intelligence, data centres, EVs and batteries, green hydrogen, and semiconductors, have rapidly 
risen. India was a leading destination for AI-related FDI in 2022, receiving 122 AI-related FDI 
projects in 2022, with multinational companies such as ABB, Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, and 
Microsoft announcing investments in the country.98 According to research by NASSCOM, India 
is an attractive destination for AI investment due to its relatively low operating costs and the 
world’s second-largest pool of highly skilled AI, machine learning, and big data workers.99
4.67	 A detailed examination of CMIE Investment Intentions and UNCTAD data on greenfield 
projects reveals that a strong correlation of more than 56 per cent exists between these data 
sources. Chart IV.30a shows that investment intentions have been a good predictor of future 
FDI inflows. FDI inflows followed the same direction as CMIE Investment Intentions till FY15; 
however, in FY16, the trend diverged.
4.68	 An estimation of FDI concentration using the Hershman-Herfindahl Index (HHI)100 
highlights a positive correlation between total FDI inflows and the concentration index, which 
implies that in years in which the Indian economy witnessed a surge in FDI inflows, FDI was 
concentrated in a few sectors only and was not broad-based across sectors, and vice-versa. 
4.69	 India has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., greenfield 
projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, 
and consultancy services. However, this may be different across the board. Therefore, where 
investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. 
Notably, the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and 
extend beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone. While several low-hanging fruits with respect to 
the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ have been plucked already over the years, further work may lie in 
details across all levels of government – national, state and local - and across regulators.
4.70	 An article in Bloomberg in April 2024101 noted that India was not competing with other 
developing nations only to attract FDI. It is competing with advanced nations who now actively 
and aggressively pursue industrial policies that privilege domestic investment by dangling 
subsidies to businesses to prevent them from investing abroad and to entice other overseas 
investors who might otherwise consider emerging nations like India. Educated labour and 
a skilled workforce coupled with a vibrant R&D culture are important magnets, apart from

political stability, policy predictability and stability, reasonable duties and taxes, dispute 
resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation. India has made considerable progress in many 
of these areas over the years. There may be unfinished work in other areas. But, above all, the 
route to sustained investor interest and consequent accumulation of knowledge and know-how 
in India may lie through better educational and skill outcomes.
4.71	 The box below discusses how increased FDI inflows from China can help in increasing 
India’s global supply chain participation along with a push to exports.
Box IV.6: China Plus One strategy
Over the last five years, a seismic change has occurred in the global manufacturing realm, with 
major multinational companies, including Apple and others, looking to 'de-risk' themselves 
from China, which was traditionally known as the 'world's factory'. This shift is primarily 
due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, growing tensions between the US and China, and 
rising costs of doing business in China. As a result, several companies have adopted a ‘China 
plus one strategy’ to reduce their reliance on China for high-tech electronic products and 
components. This approach involves supply chain decisions to decrease their risk exposure 
to China. For example, over 90 per cent of manufacturers in North America surveyed by the 
Boston Consulting Group in 2023 moved some or all of their production to other countries 
like Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, suggesting a move away from China.102 
Can India benefit from this 'China plus one' strategy? The appeal of India lies in its large 
domestic consumer market, which makes it attractive for companies to set up operations 
there. In the electronics sector, there is a focus on smartphone manufacturing and assembly. 
The Government's PLI scheme, including tax breaks and subsidies, plays a significant role in 
attracting companies. The rise in India's domestic smartphone demand is also a key factor 
in companies' decisions to invest there. For instance, Apple assembled USD 14 billion worth 
of iPhones in India during FY24, constituting 14 per cent of its global iPhone production.103 
Foxconn has started production of Apple mobile phones in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.104 
While India may not be an immediate beneficiary of the trade diversion from China, it has 
witnessed a substantial increase in its electronic exports over time. The implementation of 
the PLI scheme has been a key driver of this growth. For instance, India's electronic exports 
to the US have transitioned from a trade deficit of USD 0.6 billion in FY17 to a trade surplus 
of USD 8.7 billion in FY24, underscoring a significant increase in value addition. Within the 
electronics sector, the category that has experienced the most growth is mobile phones, with 
exports to the US rising from USD 2.2 billion in FY23 to USD 5.7 billion in FY24.
As India looks to deepen its involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs), it will look to the 
successes and strategies of East Asian economies. These economies have typically pursued

two main strategies: reducing trade costs and facilitating foreign investment. Given that 
GVCs are designed to minimise costs, countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan have 
focused on lowering their trade costs over time. For India, improving logistical efficiency 
has been a key focus, as evidenced by a noticeable rise in India's score on the World Bank's 
LPI (as discussed in para 4.49). The second strategy, focused on investment facilitation, 
includes actions to increase and stabilise foreign investment. The PLI scheme, for example, 
encourages high-quality foreign investment by offering a market-linked incentive system for 
companies to comply with.
Over the medium term, India is focusing on integrating its value chain with that of the West, 
particularly in sectors like renewable energy and advanced technology, including artificial 
intelligence, semiconductors, and next-generation telecommunications. This strategy is 
being pursued through agreements such as the Australia-India Free Trade Agreement and 
the US-India Clean Energy Initiative. As a result, the trading patterns within these sectors 
are starting to develop. For example, the tariff classifications for environmentally friendly 
technology, such as solar water heaters, waste recycling devices, and wind turbines, show 
an increase in exports to the USA from USD 199.2 million in FY20 to USD 326.9 million 
in FY24105. Further, leading American and European companies in the renewable energy 
sector, such as First Solar, Vesta, and Scatec, have established their operations in India to 
take advantage of the growing demand for green technologies. 
Will China plus one result in a total movement of trading relations away from China? This 
may not be the case. Take, for example, nations like Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea, 
which were direct beneficiaries of the US’s trade diversion from China. Even while these 
nations increased their share of exports to the US, they also displayed a concomitant rise in 
Chinese FDI.106 Therefore, the world cannot completely look past China, even as it pursues 
China plus one.
India faces two choices to benefit from China plus one strategy: it can integrate into China's 
supply chain or promote FDI from China. Among these choices, focusing on FDI from China 
seems more promising for boosting India's exports to the US, similar to how East Asian 
economies did in the past. Moreover, choosing FDI as a strategy to benefit from the China 
plus one approach appears more advantageous than relying on trade. This is because China 
is India's top import partner, and the trade deficit with China has been growing. As the US 
and Europe shift their immediate sourcing away from China, it is more effective to have 
Chinese companies invest in India and then export the products to these markets rather 
than importing from China, adding minimal value, and then re-exporting them. Further,

a recent research note from the Rhodium Group points out, “China’s dominance over so 
many product categories creates, first and foremost, a risk of economic coercion, where 
the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage.”107 The same brief 
also notes, “Brazil and Turkey have raised barriers to imports of Chinese EVs, but enacted 
measures to attract Chinese FDI in the sector.” European nations, too, have decided to follow 
a similar approach108. Hence, it is imperative that India finds the right balance between 
importing goods from China and importing capital (FDI) from China.  
Comfortable Foreign Exchange Reserves 
4.72	 A moderation in the CAD amidst large capital inflows enabled the addition of foreign 
exchange reserves (FER) in FY24. The buffer of FER insulates domestic economic activity from 
global spillovers. These reserves act as a cushion and provide liquidity, ensuring India can meet 
its external obligations. During FY24, India’s FER increased by USD 68 billion, the highest 
increase among major foreign exchange reserves-holding countries. FER stood at USD 653.7 
billion on 21 June 2024, enough to cover more than 10 months of imports projected for FY25 
and more than 98 per cent of total external debt outstanding at the end of March 2024.

4.73	 Despite FY24 being marked by geopolitical risks, rising interest rates and volatile 
commodity prices, the US economy exhibited resilience with positive economic indicators such 
as a tight labour market and upbeat consumer sentiments. These factors contributed to drawing 
global funds to US treasury markets as there was a higher demand for greenback on safe-haven 
appeal. In FY24, the US Dollar gained against virtually every major peer. The Rupee also came 
under depreciation pressure. However, INR was one of the least volatile major currencies. 
Further, it exhibited the lowest volatility in FY24 compared to the previous years. An estimation 
of volatility using the coefficient of variation (CV) highlights that CV was 0.58 during FY24, 
much lower than in the past years. The relative stability of the rupee, despite a stronger US 
dollar and elevated US treasury yields, reflects the strength of the Indian economy's sound 
macroeconomic fundamentals, financial stability, and improvements in external position. In 
the future, robust foreign inflows and comfortable trade deficits are expected to keep the rupee 
within a comfortable range.

4.77	 The box below discusses the impact of exchange rate changes on the Indian economy 
through the trade channel as well as the financial channel.
Box IV.7: Trade and Financial channels of the Exchange rate
Historically, a depreciated currency has been a key driver of export growth. The Marshal 
Lerner conditions, if met, suggest that currency depreciation can stimulate an increase 
in net exports by reducing export costs and increasing import prices. This ‘trade’ channel 
of the exchange rate has been well-documented for India. However, the exchange rate 
also influences the external sector through a ‘financial’ channel. Theory suggests that the 
financial channel of the exchange rate can potentially counterbalance the gains (or losses) 
made through the trade channel. 
A weak Rupee can affect the Balance of Payments (BoP) by changing the supply and cost 
of foreign funding. For instance, depreciation can reduce the creditworthiness of local 
borrowers if they have Rupee-denominated assets and borrow in foreign currencies. This 
could raise the cost of foreign lending and lead to a net capital outflow. Globally, appreciation 
in domestic currencies (against the dollar) has increased cross-border banking capital flows.110 
However, Kearns and Patel (2016) show that the financial channel of the exchange rate is 
generally more potent in EMEs, where unhedged foreign currency exposures are more likely 
to be present.111
109  NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies. The 
REER is defined as a weighted average of nominal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between domestic 
and foreign countries.

Over the last two decades, India’s FDI and equity portfolio inflows have totalled about 2.5 per 
cent of GDP annually (IMF, 2023).112 In general, inflows to the capital account increased by 
65 per cent between FY-14 and FY-24. Therefore, in the context of India’s large and growing 
financial account with the rest of the world, whether the Rupee should remain competitive 
is a question to ponder. 
To answer this question, the two different channels of the exchange rate were estimated 
using a trade-weighted exchange rate and a debt-weighted exchange rate. The trade-
weighted Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) provided by the RBI is used to capture the 
trade channel. The financial channel is captured by a debt-weighted exchange rate (DWER), 
which is constructed as an arithmetic average of the Rupee against major foreign currencies, 
weighted by their share in the composition of external debt.
In theory, the net BoP must equate to zero as trade surpluses (deficits) equate to capital 
account deficits (surpluses). However, in practice, countries report net Bop deficits/surpluses 
with rare instances of BoP equilibrium. Literature explains BoP disequilibria as a monetary 
disequilibrium and as the result of excess supply or demand for currency.113 Therefore, to 
study the extent to which the two channels (trade and financial) counteract the other in the 
presence of currency movement, the dependent variable used here is net BoP. 
An auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is deployed to capture the separate channels 
of a Rupee depreciation/appreciation on net Balance of Payments (BoP). The problem of 
endogeneity is controlled for in an ARDL framework in the absence of autocorrelation of 
errors. Further, multicollinearity is also not a significant issue as lags and differences of the 
variables are used. 
∆ lnBoPt = γi ∆BoPt-1 + δi ∑∆DWERt + βi ∑∆NEER+ θXt + εt
The data used is at a quarterly frequency between Q1 of FY12 to Q3 of FY24. The dependent 
variable is the net balance of payment in nominal terms calculated as Ln (BoP Credit)/
(BoP Debit); DWER represents the debt-weighted exchange rate. The coefficients δi  and 
βi indicate the elasticity of net BoP to changes in the debt channel of the exchange rate 
and the trade channel of the exchange rate. Xt includes control variables such as World 
imports, repo rate, commodity prices, domestic demand, GDP deflator and a dummy for the 
COVID-19 years (March 2020 to March 2022). Optimal lags for the regressors are chosen 
according to the AIC criterion.

The results indicate that India's trade channel is stronger than the financial channel. Over 
the long run, the net effect of an appreciation is negative ( -0.7 + 0.16). Thus, a per cent 
appreciation of the Rupee results in a net decline in the BoP by 0.54 per cent.

In addition to conducting post-estimation checks for serial correlation and parameter 
stability (CUSUM test), robustness checks were performed by studying the variables in a 
dynamic OLS framework. The result of the robustness check is provided below:

                  ‘**’ denotes significance at the 5 per cent level
The results outline that a competitive Rupee continues to boost the BoP as the benefits 
received through the trade channel outweigh the costs incurred in the financial channel. As 
noted by Longaric 2022, India’s high trade openness and low share of external debt mean 
that the trade channel effect of currency fluctuations dominates the financial channel effect. 
This contrasts with other EMEs, such as Brazil and the Philippines, whose financial channel 
effect dominates the trade effect.
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION (IIP)
4.78	 The Net IIP114 position determines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation 
by measuring the difference between its external assets and liabilities. As of the end of March 
2024, Indian residents’ overseas financial assets at USD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 
109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023, mainly due to a rise in 
reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances 
and loans. Reserve assets at USD 646.4 billion, accounting for around 62.9 per cent of India’s 
international financial assets, increased by 11.8 per cent over the same period.

114  According to the IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, IIP is a statistical statement that 
shows at a point in time the value and composition of (a) financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on non-
residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and (b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-residents. The difference 
between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.

4.79	 International liabilities at USD 1,390 billion as of the end of March 2024 were higher by 
USD 104.3 billion (8.1 per cent) as compared to the level in March 2023. The rise was attributed 
mainly to an increase in portfolio investment, loan, direct investment and other accounts 
payable. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 51.1 per cent as of March 
2024.
4.80	 Thus, the net claims of non-residents in India, valued at USD 361.7 billion as of the end 
of March 2024, declined by USD 5.5 billion over the level of March 2023. India’s international 
financial assets covered 74 per cent of international financial liabilities as of the end of March 
2024.
STABLE EXTERNAL DEBT POSITION
4.81	 The current account can also be expressed as the difference between national (both public 
and private) savings and investment.  A current account deficit may, therefore, reflect a low level 
of national savings relative to the desired level of investment. External debt, by supplementing 
domestic savings, helps countries grow faster. In developing economies, high economic growth 
is typically associated with high external debt and vice-versa. However, an unsustainable large 
stock of external debt can potentially create vulnerabilities and dent growth prospects. 
4.82	 India has managed its external debt prudently with the overarching objective of keeping 
the current account deficit within sustainable limits and encouraging non-debt creation of 
external finance. India’s external debt has been sustainable over the years, as evident in chart 
IV.38 below. The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 
2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. The share of short-term debt (with original 
maturity of up to one year) in total external debt declined to 18.5 per cent at the end of March 
2024 from 20.6 per cent at the end of March 2023. The ratio of FER to total debt stood at 97.4 
per cent as of March 2024.

OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
4.84	 Though ongoing geopolitical headwinds impacted India’s merchandise exports, 
lowering international commodity prices ensured a lower trade deficit in FY24 than in FY23. 
A narrowing merchandise trade deficit and rising service exports have improved the CAD, 
ending with a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of FY24. In the coming years, India’s trade 
deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally 
competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. Further, the recently signed FTAs 
are expected to increase the global market share of the country’s exports. Various international 
agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven 
by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances. 
4.85	 However, the risks to the performance of India’s external sector are on the downside 
due to the persistence of current geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty. Some of the 
challenges are mentioned below: -
	
Fall in demand from major trading partners: As per the DGCIS data, the US was 
India’s second-largest trading partner in FY24 after China. However, the USA’s overall 
import volume declined by 1.7 per cent in 2023 compared to a growth of 8.6 per cent in 2022, 
as per OECD. This significantly influenced export growth in trading partners, including 

External Sector
153
India.115 Rising protectionism is another risk that could undermine trade recovery in 2024 
and 2025.
	
Rise in trade cost: Attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and drought in the Panama 
Canal have resulted in trade flows being re-routed, increasing journey time and costs 
as mentioned in para 4.8 above. India’s merchandise trade relies heavily on maritime 
trade, so disturbances in major shipping routes can impact its economy. A CRISIL report116 
highlighted that the Red Sea crisis has impacted the Middle East’s fertiliser exports to India 
as imports of the Muriate of Potash from Jordan and Israel have been affected. 
	
Commodity price volatility: Fluctuations in commodity prices, especially for critical 
imports like oil, metals, and agricultural products, can impact India's trade balance and 
inflation levels. Disappointing global growth presents a downside risk, especially for 
industrial commodities. Additional trade restrictions could push food prices higher.
	
Trade policy changes: Changes in trade policies by major trading partners or geopolitical 
developments can affect India's export opportunities and market access. As per the WTO’s 
Trade Monitoring Report, November 2023117, the pace of WTO members' implementation 
of new export restrictions has increased significantly since 2020. 75 export restrictions on 
food, feed and fertilisers are still in place globally, in addition to 20 COVID-19-related export 
restrictions. For 2023, the trade covered by import restrictions in force was estimated at 
USD 2,480 billion, representing almost one-tenth of total world imports.
4.86	 It is critical to explore what these changing paradigms mean for India. Policies need to 
be a mix that straddles security concerns with economic considerations. India’s push towards 
manufacturing in complex and niche sectors through schemes such as PLI and Make in India 
aims to balance these goals. On the other hand, India’s edge in services will catalyse our 
globalisation over the coming years. A recent paper by the Peterson Institute for International 
Economics118, asserts that globalisation in services is ongoing, even as we are past the era of 
hyperglobalised trade in goods. This implies that the global demand for India’s services sector 
exports is here to stay.
4.87	 India is simultaneously working towards unlocking the potential gains from growing 
integration by augmenting the logistics front. This is evident from the large infrastructure 
deals which have been signed to ramp up trade. For instance, the International North-South 
Transport Corridor (INSTC) is expected to shorten trade time for shipments to Russia and 
Europe. Another major joint infrastructure deal, the India-Middle East Europe corridor 
(IMEC), will connect Asia with Europe via ports and railroads. Similarly, there is a concerted 
effort towards striking trade agreements with countries spanning geographies.

4.88	 Ultimately, India needs to focus on improving its competitiveness in many product areas. 
For example, India has tremendous potential in becoming a large global exporter in agricultural 
commodities. Fostering stronger regional trade ties and adding more markets for Indian goods 
will help mitigate global demand fluctuations. In an era when global economic growth is likely 
to be buffeted by geopolitical tensions and protectionism, growing India’s exports of goods and 
services will be a stiffer challenge than before. Product safety and quality consciousness in the 
private sector and policy stability in the public sector are obvious starting points to turn the 
challenge into an opportunity.

CHAPTER
05
MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK: 
A GROWTH VISION FOR 
NEW INDIA
The direct benefit of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ is the dignity of our citizens and the improvement 
in their quality of life.”
- Extracted from Hon’ble Prime Minister’s reply to the Motion of Thanks on the 
President's Address in the Lok Sabha on July 2, 2024
The Indian growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience. The structural 
reforms undertaken by the Government of India since 2014 have put the economy 
firmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in 
the world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent 
plus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the 
last decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus 
as well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy 
elucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms 
of the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to next-
gen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and 
inclusive growth. 
SETTING THE CONTEXT 
5.1.	
In 1993, the Indian economy was valued at less than USD300 billion in dollar terms at 
current prices. Fast forward to 2024, and it is estimated to have reached a staggering USD 3.6 
trillion. This represents a remarkable 12-fold increase despite the Indian rupee depreciating by 
around 3 per cent annually between 1993 and 2024. Moreover, this has been achieved without 
a big rise in the country’s overall indebtedness, indicating an efficient utilisation of capital. 
India’s per capita current dollar GDP has increased from 301.5 in 1993 to 2,484.8 in 2023,1 
which indicates a substantial improvement in the standard of living. 
5.2.	
India is a historical and long civilisation. It provided answers to many questions that 
humankind faced and still faces. It is a country with a big land mass and a huge population. It 
rightly aspires to be reckoned with as a great power in economic and other terms. China, India’s 
neighbour to the Northeast and a nation of comparable size and population and antiquity of 
civilisation as India, has grown to become a major global economic and political power in less 
than a generation. India, too, has now set for itself the goal of becoming a developed nation 
within a generation by 2047, the hundredth year of independence.

5.3.	
Today, the world faces several major fault lines. We have arrived at a multipolar world. 
It is more difficult than the bipolar world that we were used to for nearly five decades after 
the War ended. Therefore, mini and significant geopolitical conflicts are likely in the coming 
decades. 
5.4.	
At a cultural level, the rise of what is called the ‘Far Right’ by mainstream media in 
advanced nations is, in effect, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and others whose 
fortunes are bound by and tied to their national geographies. This clash of priorities transcends 
economics. It includes cultural and social preferences and values. Therefore, along with 
economic stagnation and geopolitical conflicts, societies in advanced nations are fracturing 
from within, too. The literature analysing long political, social, and civilisational cycles has 
warned us of a fairly to severely turbulent three decades until the middle of the century.
5.5.	
The idea of economic globalisation has run its course. It may not be reversed fully, but 
it has peaked. It will continue to face obstacles as economic policies worldwide pivot to the 
promotion of national champions for reasons too well-known to bear repetition here. Along 
with the peaking of globalisation, there is also a rethinking of the role of government in national 
economic strategy as inequality, poverty, and indebtedness have become pressing issues 
in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic. The clamour for easy answers to these global and 
generational challenges has provided an excuse for interventionist policies despite their poor 
empirical record in achieving prosperous or more equal societies.
5.6.	
Lastly, there is the crisis posed by climate change and global warming. Developed 
countries are pushing for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
With their policies having questionable effectiveness in achieving emission reduction in their 
own countries, they are ramping up pressure on developing nations. Developing nations are 
struggling to restore economic growth and reduce poverty and debt in their countries, all of 
which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. They lack both technology and financial 
resources to undertake the necessary transition to cleaner fuels. Developed nations are generous 
with pledges and parsimonious in delivering on them. Further, there are huge uncertainties as 
to the efficacy of drastic measures to combat climate change and their economic impact over 
the next half to a full decade. Slower growth, stagnation, or outright contraction might trigger 
social unrest and exodus of people to the West.
5.7.	
This is the global backdrop to India’s growth, prosperity, and superpower aspirations for 
the next quarter century. In contrast, during its rise, China did not face many of these challenges, 
and even the ones they faced were fairly milder, in comparison. For realising India’s aspirations, 
despite the changed circumstances, a good place to start is to acknowledge and recognise that 
the terrain has changed to be able to traverse through it and reach the destination.
5.8.	
India has to sustain its economic growth rate over a quarter century and do it sustainably, 
keeping the environment and climate in mind. Water stress looms large, as does air pollution. 
Life expectancy, much higher now than in the past, has stagnated in recent years. It has to 
educate and skill its youth to stay ahead of the curve so that they can work with emerging 
technologies while overcoming the accumulated education and skill deficits, accentuated by the 
pandemic, that make it harder to raise productivity even with the current state of technological 

Medium Term Outlook
157
progress. It is required to maintain a constant vigil on its borders both in the Northwest and 
in the Northeast. With the digitalisation of the Indian economy, cybersecurity assumes a much 
higher degree of importance and urgency. Therefore, providing financial resources for national 
security is imperative. Fiscal resources have to increase without compromising on economic 
growth. 
5.9.	
The capacity in terms of numbers and the capability of the State in terms of competence, 
skills, and attitude are additional factors that would determine the outcomes of India’s 
economic and social goals. Economic policies have to be crafted in such a manner that they 
do not address issues narrowly or incompletely while rendering problems in other areas more 
intractable. Goals for a higher share of renewable power with its implications for land usage 
and dependence on inimical powers for resources are one example. The impact of farm sector 
policies on water security is another example. 
5.10.	 With the global backdrop described earlier likely to come in the way of India boosting its 
exports at the same pace and level as East Asian countries and national security considerations 
likely to make foreign direct investment flows volatile year-to-year, India has to generate 
domestic resources mostly for its own investment and growth priorities. Geopolitics imposes 
its ceiling on external deficit and, consequently, external financing.
5.11.	 Against this background, the medium-term growth outlook for the Indian economy, 
which will be detailed in this chapter, is premised on the following key tenets:
	
First, increasing geoeconomic fragmentation and the consequent resource 
nationalism have significant growth-limiting impacts on countries. It has given 
rise to a trade-off between efficiency and resilience that did not exist a decade earlier. 
Ensuring the security of supply through building buffers and slack has replaced the ability 
to operate at the frontiers of efficiency. ‘Just in case’ has replaced ‘Just in time’. 
 Second, a global trust deficit is driving countries to pursue policies focused 
on enabling them to become self-reliant and protect them from external shocks, 
especially in sectors of strategic importance. Therefore, the balance between inward-looking 
policies versus outward-looking policies needs to become more nuanced going forward;
 Third, the integration of climate change strategies into national development 
policy and planning is not merely an environmental imperative but more, as 
it impacts socio-economic stability, public health, banking, and public finances. Climate 
change imposes costs and requires policymakers to balance adaptation to climate change 
and emission mitigation. It also necessitates a trade-off between energy security and 
economic development on the one hand and energy transition on the other.
	
Fourth, for better and worse, technology is emerging as the biggest strategic 
differentiator determining the economic prosperity of nations. Its productivity-
enhancing potential is beyond doubt, but the social impact of emerging technologies such 
as Artificial Intelligence (AI) via labour market disruptions and labour displacement is 
barely understood. It also has the potential to skew the capital and labour shares of income 
in favour of the former.

Economic Survey 2023-24
158
	
Fifth, countries across the board have limited policy space to manoeuvre, given 
the multiple crises confronting the global economy. Therefore, recognition and acceptance 
of trade-offs have become more necessary than before for policymakers. 
	
Sixth, in the last decade (2014-2024), the Government of India has pursued big-ticket 
reforms focused on restoring the health of the economy, elevating the potential growth 
by relieving supply-side constraints and strengthening its capabilities, capable of fulfilling 
the growth aspirations of the people in the present and the Amrit Kaal. The next stage 
is to ensure that these reforms are implemented correctly and this will require intense 
engagement with state governments, the private sector, and civil society. Going forward, 
the Government’s focus must turn to bottom-up reform and the strengthening 
of the plumbing of governance so that the structural reforms of the last decade 
yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.  
KEY AREAS OF POLICY FOCUS IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM 
TERM
5.12.	 Based on the state of the play of the Indian economy, both at a macro level and sectoral 
level, that has been elaborated in the rest of the chapters of this Survey, the present section draws 
out some of the key areas of policy focus to ensure that India’s growth continues unimpeded, 
crossing the milestone of becoming the third largest economy of the world in short order, on its 
way to scaling greater heights. 
5.13.	 Generating productive employment: Productive jobs are vital for growth and 
inclusion. India’s workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 Crore, of which more than 45 per 
cent are employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, 
and 13.0 per cent in construction2. While the services sector remains a major job creator, the 
construction sector has been rising in prominence lately, driven by the government’s push 
for infrastructure. However, since construction jobs are largely informal and low-paid, there 
is a need for avenues for the labour force leaving agriculture. Meanwhile, the manufacturing 
sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade due to the legacy of bad 
loans and appears to have rebounded since 2021-22. According to UN population projections, 
India’s working-age population (15-59 years) will continue to grow until 2044. The chapter on 
Employment (chapter 8) estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh 
jobs annually in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these 
many jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside 
of agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improving 
productivity in agriculture. 
5.14.	 Skill gap challenge: Sixty-five per cent of India’s fast-growing population is under 35, 
and many lack the skills needed by a modern economy3. Estimates show that about 51.25 per 
cent of the youth is deemed employable. In other words, about one in two are not yet readily 
employable, straight out of college. However, it must be noted that the percentage has improved 
from around 34 per cent to 51.3 per cent in the last decade4. The 2022-23 Annual Report of

the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) highlights that “as per NSSO, 
2011-12 (68th round) report on Status of Education and Vocational Training in India, among 
persons of age 15-59 years, about 2.2 per cent reported to have received formal vocational 
training and 8.6 per cent reported to have received non-formal vocational training”. The 
Annual Report further goes on enumerate the challenges in the skilling and entrepreneurship 
landscape in the country, such as “: (i) Public perception that views skilling as the last option 
meant for those who have not been able to progress/have opted out of the formal academic 
system. (ii) Skill development programmes of the Central Government are spread across more 
than 20 Ministries/Departments without any robust coordination and monitoring mechanism 
to ensure convergence. (iii) Multiplicity in assessment and certification systems that leads to 
inconsistent outcomes and causes confusion among the employers. (iv) Paucity of trainers, 
inability to attract practitioners from industry as faculty. (v) Mismatch between demand and 
supply at the sectoral and spatial levels. (vi) Limited mobility between skill and higher education 
programmes and vocational education. (vii) Very low coverage of apprenticeship programmes. 
(viii) Narrow and often obsolete skill curricula. (ix) Declining labour force participation rate of 
women. (x) Pre-dominant non-farm, unorganized sector employment with low productivity but 
no premium for skilling. (xi) Non- inclusion of entrepreneurship in formal education system. 
(xii) Lack of mentorship and adequate access to finance for start-ups. (xiii) Inadequate impetus 
to innovation driven entrepreneurship. (xiv) Lack of assured wage premium for skilled people”. 
The Chapter on employment (chapter 8)  provides a detailed analysis of the skill gap challenge 
and the efforts underway to address the same.
5.15.	 Tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector: Despite its centrality in 
India’s growth trajectory, the agriculture sector continues to face structural issues that have 
implications for India’s economic growth. The foremost concern confronting the sector pertains 
to sustaining agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise beyond acceptable limits 
while incentivising farmers to raise production.5 There is also a need to improve price discovery 
mechanisms for agriculture products, increase efficiency, reduce disguised unemployment, 
address the fragmentation of landholding, and increase crop diversification, among a host of 
other issues. All of these call for the upgradation of agricultural technology, the application of 
modern skills in farm practices, enhancing agricultural marketing avenues, price stabilisation, 
the adoption of innovation in farming, lowering wastages in the use of fertiliser, water, and 
other inputs, and improving the agriculture-industry linkages. The chapter on agriculture 
(Chapter 9) discusses the policies being pursued by the Government to enable agriculture to 
tap its full potential.
5.16.	 Easing the compliance requirements and financing bottlenecks confronting 
MSMEs: MSMEs have played a key role in defining the economic trajectory of some of the 
major economies, such as Germany, Switzerland, Canada, China, etc. In India, the Government 
has been paying focused attention to enabling the MSME sector to occupy the centre stage 
in India’s economic story. However, the sector continues to face extensive regulation and 
compliance requirements and faces significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely 
funding being one of the core concerns. Licensing, Inspection, and Compliance requirements

160
that MSMEs have to deal with, imposed particularly by sub-national governments, hold them 
back from growing to their potential and being job creators of substance. Threshold-based 
concessions and exemptions create the unintended effect of incentivising enterprises to cap 
their sizes below the thresholds. Therefore, threshold-based incentives must have sunset 
clauses. Further, many MSMEs struggle to secure the necessary funds to start, operate, or 
expand their business due to a variety of reasons including lack of collateral or credit history, 
high interest rates, complex documentation requirements, and long processing times, etc. The 
Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance, in its April 2022 report on ‘Strengthening Credit 
Flows to the MSME, noted that the credit gap in the MSME sector is estimated to be around Rs 
20-25 lakh crore. The government has launched several schemes, such as the Pradhan Mantri 
Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises, aimed 
at providing affordable credit to MSMEs. The initiatives have shown considerable promise in 
addressing these challenges. The Chapter on Industry (Chapter 10) discusses these issues in 
detail. 
5.17.	 Managing India’s green transition: India has committed to reducing its greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by 33-35 per cent (from 2005 levels), increasing the share of non-fossil 
fuel-based electricity to 40 per cent and enhancing forest cover to absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes 
of carbon dioxide by 20306. However, the path of green transition in India needs to (a) ensure 
the consistency of the E-Mobility policy with the required and optimal energy mix between 
traditional and renewable source; (b) ensure grid stability for E-Mobility to become pervasive; 
(c) develop or acquire storage technology at affordable costs for the share of renewable energy 
in power generation to rise; (d) reckon with the opportunity cost of land and capital being used 
for renewable energy given that India’s needs for land and capital far exceed their availability;  
(e) decide on the role and the share of nuclear energy in the energy mix;  (f) recognise and 
deal with challenges posed by dependence on China for critical minerals, which are crucial raw 
materials needed for E-Mobility and renewable energy generation; (g) examine the implications 
of phasing down coal for bank balance sheets; (h) recognise and estimate the impact of phasing 
out of coal-fired thermal plants on the freight revenues of the Indian Railways and (i) study 
implications of replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with e-vehicles particularly on 
the sale of petrol and diesel and the tax revenues that such sale generates for the Union and State 
governments. Last but not least, India not only has to deal with climate change and undertake 
energy transition but also deal with the protectionism of the developed countries. Europe is 
on course to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Tax and both the United Kingdom and 
the United States are in different stages of imposing their versions of it in due course. These 
taxes are in contravention to the spirit of the Paris Agreement that recognised ‘Common But 
Differentiated Responsibilities’.
5.18.	 Further, the overarching climate actions to achieve Intended Nationally Determined 
Contributions (INDC) goals require massive financial resources. Preliminary estimates indicate 
that the aggregate investment support required by India to achieve its 2070 net-zero target will 
6  These goals are articulated in the government’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) under

161
be USD 1.4 trillion at an average of USD 28 billion per year7. Raising financial resources for 
climate change adaptation and mitigation actions of this scale is an unprecedented challenge, 
especially given that India’s climate action has been largely financed through domestic resources 
and the flow of international finance has been very limited. As per the Reserve Bank of India, 
bridging this substantial funding gap necessitates allocating 2.5 per cent of India's annual GDP 
to green finance. A 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative8 found that domestic sources 
accounted for the majority of green finance in India, at 87 per cent and 83 per cent in fiscal 
years 2019 and 2020, respectively. While international sources are increasing (from 13 per cent 
in FY 2019 to 17 per cent in FY 2020), they are still insufficient to meet India's net-zero target9. 
Mobilising substantial capital from traditional sources presents multifaceted challenges in 
emerging economies like India. The perceived sovereign risks associated with EMDEs and the 
capital-intensive nature of such projects, coupled with lengthy gestation periods and evolving 
regulatory frameworks, can create misalignment between investor expectations and project 
timelines. It is also pertinent to note that the flows of global capital to developing countries 
have been impeded by high costs of capital. Despite securing a good rating on its green bond 
framework, Indian sovereign green bonds have hardly received any ‘greenium’10  from private 
investors. It is more a ‘wall of capital’ than a ‘flood of capital’ that is waiting to fund energy 
transition in EMDEs. It just isn’t mobile. All of these together have severely hampered the flow 
of finance for green transition projects. The issues related to climate finance and India’s green 
transition are discussed in detail in the chapter on Climate Change and Energy (chapter 6).
5.19. 	 The Chinese conundrum: The dynamics of India-China economic relations continue 
to be extremely complex and intertwined. The Chinese domination over the global supply chains 
across product categories is a key global concern, especially in the wake of supply disruption 
accompanying the war in Ukraine. Even though India is the fastest-growing G20 country and is 
now recording growth rates that outpace China’s, India’s economy is still a fraction of China's. 
In the context of energy transition, China's near-monopoly over the production and processing 
of critical and rare earth minerals has already been a cause of global concern. It will also have 
significant repercussions for India’s renewable energy programme, which is vulnerable because 
of its massive dependence on imported raw materials11. Against this background, it may not 
be the most prudent approach to think that India can take up the slack from China vacating 
certain spaces in manufacturing. Indeed, recent data cast doubt on whether China is even 
vacating light manufacturing. The questions that India faces are: (a) Is it possible to plug India 
into the global supply chain without plugging itself into the China supply chain? and (b) what 
is the right balance between importing goods and importing capital from China?  As countries 
attempt to reshore and friendshore, India’s policy choices concerning China are exacting.

Box V.I: The Chinese Manufacturing Juggernaut: A Threat to EMEs12 
It is increasingly seen that emerging economies are introducing import restrictions on 
Chinese goods while accelerating a push for free trade elsewhere to protect their domestic 
manufacturers. 
These protectionist measures directed against Chinese products are emerging due to the 
threat that the overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is posing to other countries, 
especially in the EMDEs. China’s manufacturing trade surplus has been ballooning since 
2019 due to weak domestic demand and expanding industrial capacity. The mismatch 
between domestic supply and demand in China has widened in the past few years, leading 
to Chinese companies exploring additional markets overseas. This is leading to prices 
collapsing globally and driving other national producers out of business, especially in 
product categories where China dominates. For instance, the poor performance of China’s 
property sector since 2021 created significant overcapacity leading to a collapse in global 
steel prices, which now puts significant pressure on producers in India, Vietnam, Brazil, and 
other countries. Estimates show that China’s steel product exports are surging again—by 27 
per cent so far in 2024—after 35 per cent growth last year.
China’s dominance over a large number of product categories creates a risk of economic 
coercion, where the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage. 
This is most evident in the case of the export of rare earth and critical minerals which are 
of high priority in the green transition efforts of countries. China’s dominance also has 
led to monopolistic practices which has considerably limited the space for new entrants 
to emerge as new manufacturing powers. Recent research by Rhodium Group observes 
that “The Chinese government can encourage companies to partner together, merge and 
consolidate, coordinate to gain market shares, raise prices, restrict access to products where 
they already have substantial market power, or favour domestic firms in their suppliers and 
client networks.”
It is also interesting to note that "while China still needs to import high-tech products 
from rich industrialized economies, it imports very few low-tech goods, where developing 
countries would have a comparative advantage. This is largely a result of deliberate policy 
interventions, which have intensified in recent years."
All these above factors have together played a key role in constraining the manufacturing 
sector of EMDEs. While EMDEs are resorting to import restrictions as a policy option to 
deal with the Chinese challenge, it is pertinent to note that some Chinese goods are so cheap 
that no amount of tariff can reduce their price competitiveness. Further, some Chinese 
products can move past these restrictions without being noticed since they are packaged in 
third countries. Meanwhile, China has started retaliating against these import restrictions 
which has further complicated the manufacturing landscape for EMDEs. For instance, in

response the India’s anti-dumping probe against Chinese entities, China has been 
quietly blocking India’s access to solar equipment. Given this, dealing with the Chinese 
manufacturing juggernaut will test the policy mettle of EMDEs. Developing countries will 
have to figure out a way of meeting the import competition from China and, at the same 
time, boosting domestic manufacturing capabilities, sometimes with the collaboration of 
Chinese investment and technology.
As the Rhodium group research points out, Brazil and Turkey recently raised tariffs on the 
import of E-Vehicles from China but, at the same time, took steps to attract Chinese FDI in 
the sector.
India has a similar decision to make, given its large bilateral trade deficit with China. It 
makes India vulnerable to potential abrupt supply disruptions. Replacing some well-chosen 
imports with investments from China raises the prospect of creating domestic know-how 
down the road. It may have other risks, but as with many other matters, we don’t live in a 
first-best world. We have to choose between second and third-best choices.
In sum, to boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is 
inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying 
solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to 
make.
5.20.	 Deepening the corporate bond market: Going forward, the investment needed 
to steer India’s economic growth has to be through a multitude of financing options beyond 
bank financing. India needs both banks and capital markets to provide the required finances 
sourced from a sustained high level of household savings. An active corporate bond market 
becomes critical in this context. An efficient corporate bond market with lower costs and 
quicker issuing time can offer an efficient and cost-effective source of longer-term funds for 
corporates. However, the size of the corporate bond market in India, scaled by GDP, remains 
small compared to other major Asian emerging markets such as Malaysia, Korea, and China.13 
The Indian corporate bond market lacks depth since it is dominated by highly-rated issuers and 
a limited investor base of domestic institutions.
5.21.	 Tackling inequality: Globally, widening inequality is emerging as a crucial economic 
challenge confronting policymakers. The 2022 State of Inequality in India report14 observed that 
in India, the top 1 per cent accounts for 6-7 per cent of the total incomes earned, while the top 
10 per cent accounts for one-third of total incomes earned. The Government places significant 
focus on this issue and all the critical policy interventions being undertaken with a focus on 
creating jobs, integrating the informal sector with the formal sector, and expanding the female 
labour force are aimed at effectively addressing inequality. Tax policies on the treatment of 
capital and labour incomes will likely play a more important role in the coming years, especially 
since the deployment of technology like AI may have a more deleterious impact on employment 
and income.

5.22.	 Improving the quality of health of India’s young population: The Indian Council 
for Medical Research, in its latest Dietary Guidelines for Indians published in April 202415, 
estimates that 56.4 per cent of the total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets. The 
report also goes on to observe that the upsurge in the consumption of highly processed foods 
laden with sugars and fat, coupled with reduced physical activity and limited access to diverse 
foods, exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity problems. Estimates show 
that the adult obesity rate in India has more than tripled, and the annual rise in children’s is the 
steepest in the world for India, behind Vietnam and Namibia, according to the World Obesity 
Federation16. The National Family Health Survey, 2019-2021 presents a very penetrating 
portrait of the health status of India’s population (Box V.2). If India needs to reap the gains 
of its demographic dividend, it is critical that its population’s health parameters transition 
towards a balanced and diverse diet. 
Box V.2: India’s expanding obesity challenge: Observations from 
National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), 2019-2021
Obesity is emerging as a serious concern among India’s adult population. According to 
National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS-5), the percentage of men facing obesity in the age 
bracket 18-69 has increased to 22.9 per cent in NFHS-5 from 18.9 per cent in NFHS-4. For 
women, it has increased from 20.6% (NFHS-4) to 24.0% (NFHS-5). The spatial distribution 
of India’s obesity challenge as per NFHS-5 vis-à-vis NFHS-4 reveals the following:
	
In Tamil Nadu, for men, it is 37.0% (vs. 28.2% in NFHS-4), and it is 40.4% for women 
(vs. 30.9% in NFHS-4). 
	
In Uttar Pradesh, for women, it has gone up to 21.3% (NFHS-5) from 16.5% (NFHS-4), 
and for men, it has gone up to 18.5% (NFHS-5) from 12.5% (NFHS-4). 
	
In Kerala, for women, it has gone up to 38.1% (NFHS-5) from 32.4% (NFHS-4), and for 
men, it has gone up to 36.4% (NFHS-5) from 28.5% (NFHS-4). 
	
In West Bengal, for women, it has gone up to 22.7% (NFHS-5) from 19.9% (NFHS-4), 
and for men, it has gone up to 16.2% (NFHS-5) from 14.2% (NFHS-4). 
	
In Karnataka, the increase over NFHS-4 is 7% points for women (30.1% vs. 23.3%) and 
nearly 9% points (30.9% vs. 22.1%) for men.
	 In Andhra, it is 36.3% for women (vs. 33.2%). However, for men, the number has 
dropped to 31.1% (vs. 33.5%). 
	
At 30.1% and 32.3%, respectively, the proportion of women and men who are overweight 
in Telangana has increased from 28.6% for women to 24.2% for men in NFHS-4.
	
In Maharashtra, for women, it has remained the same across NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 at 
23.4%, while for men, it has gone up to 24.7% (NFHS-5) from 23.8% (NFHS-4).

	
In Madhya Pradesh, for women, it has gone up to 16.6% (NFHS-5) from 13.6% (NFHS-
4), and for men, it has gone up to 15.6% (NFHS-5) from 10.9% (NFHS-4). 
	
In Jharkhand, for women, it has gone up to 11.9% (NFHS-5) from 10.3% (NFHS-4), and 
for men, it has gone up to 15.1% (NFHS-5) from 11.1% (NFHS-4). 
	
In Bihar, for women, it has gone up to 15.9% (NFHS-5) from 11.7% (NFHS-4), and for 
men, it has gone up to 14.7% (NFHS-5) from 12.6% (NFHS-4). 
	
In the NCT (Delhi), the proportion of women with obesity is 41.3% (vs 33.5%), and for 
men, it is 38.0% (vs 24.6%).
At the All-India level, a quick perusal of the data shows that the incidence of obesity, as 
per NFHS5, is significantly higher in urban India than in rural India (29.8% vs. 19.3% for 
men and 33.2% vs. 19.7% for women). Combined with an ageing population in some states, 
obesity presents a concerning situation. Preventive measures must be taken to enable 
citizens to have a healthier lifestyle. Here, it is pertinent to note that the NFHS-5 Survey 
overlapped with the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, with restrictions on outside activities 
and lockdowns, sedentary lifestyles may have become more entrenched, resulting in the 
obesity proportion going up much more in NFHS-5. If the trend reverses in NFHS-6, it will 
be a healthy sign.
GROWTH STRATEGY FOR AMRIT KAAL: STRONG, 
SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE 
5.23.	 The policy reforms that the Government of India has been following over the past decade 
have laid the foundation for sustained moderate to high growth in the coming years. To sustain 
growth for nearly a generation up to 2047 or more and to ensure that it makes people’s lives 
better and fulfills their aspirations, bottom-up reforms are necessary. This section presents a 
six-pronged growth strategy that can guide the bottom-up reform process going forward.
5.24.	 Strategy for boosting private sector investment: India’s private gross fixed capital 
formation must accelerate in Machinery & Equipment and Intellectual Property products so 
that quality jobs can be created. The focus of the Government should be on creating an enabling 
policy and regulatory environment for the upgradation of capacity and know-how of component 
manufacturers, increasing the availability of trained human resources, addressing resource 
bottlenecks and regulatory impediments, etc. Capital formation in the private sector, after the 
consolidation in the second decade due to balance sheet issues, has begun to recover post-Covid. 
Nonetheless, there is significant scope for boosting India’s private investment, especially in the 
context of investment requirements facing the Indian economy in the areas of infrastructure, 
green transition, etc. The Government of India has undertaken significant initiatives in this 
direction, which include Aatmanirbhar packages, the introduction of the Production Linked 
Incentive (PLI), investment opportunities under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) 
and National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), India Industrial Land Bank (IILB), Industrial Park 

Economic Survey 2023-24
166
Rating System (IPRS), the soft launch of the National Single Window System (NSWS)17, etc. 
The focus needs to be on the implementation of these measures with a target of putting the 
Private Sector Non-Residential Investment (including equipment, structures, software, and 
R&D) on a sustainable footing so that it can catalyse the efforts towards increasing investment 
to 35 per cent  of GDP. 
5.25.	 Strategy for the growth and expansion of India’s Mittelstand18: Strengthening 
India’s MSME sector is central to India’s growth in the coming years. MSMEs are the backbone 
of the Indian economy, contributing approximately 30 per cent of the country’s GDP, 45 per 
cent of manufacturing output, and providing employment to 11 crore of India’s population19. 
The Government of India has been proactive in boosting the growth of the MSME sector,  
through initiatives such as the allocation of  5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee 
Scheme (ECLGS) for businesses, including MSMEs; equity infusion of  50,000 crore through 
the MSME Self-Reliant India Fund; New revised criteria for the classification of MSMEs; 
rollout of Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) programme with an outlay 
of  6,000 crores over 5 years; Launch of Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) on 11.01.2023 to bring 
the Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) under the formal ambit for availing the benefit under 
Priority Sector Lending (PSL)20. These initiatives have been formulated keeping in mind the 
key challenges the sector faces, primarily for access to timely and affordable credit. Important 
though it is, however, financing is only one of the key challenges that the sector faces.
5.26.	 Going forward, for the Mittelstand to expand, deregulation is a vital policy 
contribution. That is why the revival or creation of institutional mechanisms for dialogue 
with states on required policy changes is essential. Much of the action has to happen at the 
level of sub-national (state and local) governments. Physical and digital connectivity 
(industrial and freight corridors), infrastructure upgrade and development, the 
introduction of bullet trains, and the manufacture of semiconductor chips will contribute 
to the growth of the sector through the supply-chain network and the growth of ancillary 
industries that they catalyse, apart from the inspirational effects that projects such as building 
semiconductor fab and introducing a bullet train will have when they are operational. MSME 
entrepreneurs also need training in critical areas of enterprise management, such as human 
resource management, financial management, and technology. These interventions have to be 
targeted, tailored to the circumstances of each sector, and practical rather than academic. The 
productivity of owner-entrepreneurs unleashed by such training will be immense. 
5.27.	 Export strategy is also a crucial component of elevating the manufacturing share of GDP 
and growing the country’s Mittelstand. For instance, ‘Make in India Mittelstand (MIIM),’ 
a collaboration between India and Germany, focuses on driving innovation and enhancing 
economic cooperation by encouraging small and medium-sized German companies to invest 
17  PIB press release of Ministry of Commerce & Industry dated 9th Aug, 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/yaxwv8xy)

have proved successful in enduring economic change and turbulence. It is usually defined as a statistical category 
of small and medium-sized enterprises with annual revenues up to 50 million Euro and a maximum of 500

and manufacture in India. Since its inception in September 2015, the MIIM programme 
has supported more than 151 German Mittelstand companies, resulting in a total declared 
investment exceeding €1.4 Bn in India21, as of August 2021.  A majority of these investments 
came in the automotive, renewables, construction, consumer goods, electronics and electricals, 
chemical, and waste/ water management sectors. Striking the right balance between the 
trilemma of trade with China, investment by China, and India’s territorial and non-territorial 
integrity and security is part of the strategy of growing India’s Mittelstand.
5.28.	 Strategy for removing the growth impediments in the agricultural sector: The 
importance of the agriculture sector in the Indian economy and the impediments confronting 
the sector have been discussed in detail in the literature. Agriculture is at the nexus of three of 
the greatest challenges of the 21st century – sustaining food and nutrition security, adaptation 
and mitigation of climate change, and sustainable use of critical resources such as water, energy, 
and land. Agriculture and allied sectors such as horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and dairy and 
activities such as food processing hold significant potential for gainful employment. Given the 
geopolitical and technological threats that both manufacturing and service sectors face, it makes 
immense sense to do whatever it takes to realise the latent employment potential in agriculture. 
It is both urgent and important for India to re-imagine the contours of its primary sector for the 
next generation. India may have to abandon the old development playbook of moving on from 
agriculture to industry and services as economic development matures. Far from fading away 
with economic development as has happened with other countries in the past, in the changed 
geopolitical and evolving climatic circumstances, it may have a very important role to play in 
India’s physical, food, and economic security.
Box V.3: A farmer-friendly policy framework
The Indian agriculture sector is a success story. The country has come a long way from being 
a food deficit and importing country in the Sixties to being a net exporter of agricultural 
products. At the same time, it is important to recognise that India has a good scope to enhance 
value addition in agriculture and make employment in agri-value chains both remunerative 
and attractive among Indian youth. Unlike East Asian economies and developed countries of 
the West, India has yet to fully exploit the potential of agriculture to contribute to economic 
growth and employment generation. 
Indian agriculture is not in a crisis now but requires a serious structural transformation 
because climate change and water criticality loom large in the times to come. The surge 
in agricultural employment in Covid years due to reverse migration, the decline in the 
growth rate of value addition in agriculture in FY24, and an extremely hot summer in the 
Northwestern and central regions of the country in the summer of 2024 with rising water 
stress and energy consumption make a serious and honest stock-taking of India’s farm sector 
policies imperative. If we grasp the nettle, then the chances of enhancing the contribution of 
the farm sector to national food and nutritional security, as well as economic prosperity in 
rural India, go up considerably. Higher and well-shared prosperity in the rural economy can

Economic Survey 2023-24
168
help spur much-needed demand for industrial goods, thus spurring a manufacturing sector 
take-off. Thus, agriculture has a much higher multiplier effect on overall GDP than indicated 
by its direct contribution.
In a growing economy, the share of agriculture declines over time. That is normal. That 
is considered progress. Households, as their incomes rise, do not consume more food 
proportionately. The share of food in their consumption expenditure goes down, famously 
regarded as Engel’s law. However, it does not mean that food is less consequential to their 
well-being. Within food, the expenditure on nutritious food (protein and vitamins) such as 
livestock products (milk and meat), fish, fruits, and vegetables goes up, which is in line with 
what is known as Benette’s law. 
Agriculture and farmers matter for a nation. Most countries understand that. India is 
no exception. India subsidises their water, electricity, and fertilisers. The former two 
are provided virtually free. Their incomes are not taxed. The government offers them a 
minimum support price (MSP) for 23 selected commodities. Monthly cash support is offered 
to farmers through the PM-KISAN scheme. In the past and in some cases, even now, Indian 
governments – national and sub-national – have waived their loans. So, governments in 
India spend enough resources to look after the farmers well. Yet, a case can be made that 
they can be served better with some re-orientation of existing and new policies.
Farm products are doubtless subject to the interplay of market forces. If anything, the relative 
inelasticity of food consumption works in their favour. This creates a conundrum. Prices rise 
when weather or other factors adversely impact the harvest. Farmers respond by increasing 
the area under cultivation for the next year, leading to a glut in supply, which drags down 
prices. On both occasions, farmers fail to reap any rewards – because of inadequate produce 
in the first instance and lower prices in the second. 
Another risk for farmers is when output drops due to drought or drenching at harvest time. 
Prices rise, but the farmer is unable to benefit from the produce because it is inadequate. 
So, farming needs insurance. The challenge is to figure out the best forms of insurance 
and price support for farmers that do not distort incentives and create other costs for the 
economy, such as excessive water consumption, depletion of groundwater, soil quality 
erosion, and, equally, health costs through indirect encouragement of excess consumption 
of carbohydrates.
In theory, this insurance can come in the form of price support or income support. Price 
support interventions include direct price floors like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or 
price-gap support like the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana that Madhya Pradesh experimented 
with in one season but gave up subsequently. Income support in the form of direct benefit 
transfers (DBT) like the PM KISAN is the preferred form of agriculture subsidy in many 
developed countries. Crop insurance, like the Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), 
is another form of income support, though it has a mixed record globally.  
Given the vagaries of weather and the inherent difficulties of responding to prices promptly, 
there is an economic and moral case for farmers to be supported when market prices fail 
them. At the same time, farmers must have the freedom to benefit from market prices when 
market prices operate in their favour.

Medium Term Outlook
169
This often puts governments in the horns of a dilemma because, in relatively low-income 
countries, the interests of low-income consumers matter. Therefore, in addition to 
supporting farmers, governments are forced to intervene in the market to stabilise prices 
through policies like open market sales, trade controls, and measures against hoarding 
and speculation. In India, these measures come on top of the massive Public Distribution 
System (PDS) that underpins food security for the vast majority of the population, especially 
the poor and vulnerable.
However, such price stabilisation measures aimed at consumers often conflict with income-
support policies for the farmers. Governments have no option but to do a delicate balancing 
act. Here, the combination of policies becomes important. It is about a basket of policies 
that serve the interests of both farmers and consumers. There is a strong case here that both 
with farmers and consumers, income top-ups, i.e., direct cash transfers, are more effective. 
Direct transfers allow the markets to function.
How do we let the markets function in the interests of the farmer? What can governments 
do?
(1) 	By not banning futures or options markets at the first sign of price spikes.  
These markets do not hurt consumers or farmers at all times. The bar for such bans 
must be set so high that their recourse must be almost non-existent. The intelligent 
regulatory design of such markets can obviate the need for bureaucratic interference in 
the futures market for agricultural commodities. 
(2) 	By invoking export bans only under exceptional circumstances and allowing 
domestic consumers to substitute, especially if the agricultural commodities in question 
are not essential consumption items such as foodgrains. Even in those cases, the 
government can allow substitution effects to play out before responding to domestic 
supply concerns. For example, if sugar prices rise, consumers can consume less of it or 
switch to jaggery. It may even be a good thing for their health. In general, it is far easier 
for consumers to substitute or pare back consumption than for farmers to endure big 
losses because of ad hoc export bans or huge imports.
	
Farmers should be allowed to benefit from higher international prices. Bans on food 
exports also need to be telegraphed in advance lest hunger and famine elsewhere in the 
world worsen.
(3) 	By re-examining the inflation-targeting framework. Food constitutes a very 
high portion of the consumer price index in developing countries. That is par for the 
course. Hence, when central banks in developing countries target headline inflation, 
they effectively target food prices. So, when food prices rise, inflation targets come 
under threat. Therefore, the central bank appeals to the government to bring down 
the increase in the prices of food products. That prevents farmers from benefiting 
from the rise in terms of trade in their favour. India’s inflation targeting framework 
should consider targeting inflation, excluding food. Higher food prices are, more 
often, not demand-induced but supply-induced. Short-run monetary policy tools are 
meant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth.

Economic Survey 2023-24
170
    Deploying them to deal with inflation caused by supply constraints may be 
counterproductive. Therefore, it is worth exploring whether India’s inflation targeting 
framework should target the inflation rate excluding food. Hardships caused by higher 
food prices for poor and low-income consumers can be handled through direct benefit 
transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations.
(4)	 Specifically, with reference to India, by increasing the Total Net Irrigated Area. 
Several states are well below the national average. Investment in irrigation may make 
monsoon-watching a non-event, but it would enhance farmers’ income security. Not 
only that, as in the case of power generation plants where the plant load factor has scope 
for improvement, India’s irrigation efficiency can also improve. It is only 30-40 per 
cent for surface water and 50-60 per cent for groundwater. This calls for better water 
utilisation farming practices and technologies like drip and fertigation. It will help raise 
productivity and cut down water and fertiliser use by almost 50 per cent. 
(5) 	Besides these, by making farming consistent with climate considerations. 
India produces too much foodgrains and sugar, too few pulses, oil seeds, and other cash 
crops. Grains such as rice and sugarcane are water-guzzling crops. Water criticality is 
escalating in India. Further, among foodgrains, the cultivation of paddy gives rise to 
methane emissions. Its methane emission potential is considerable. Sometimes, and 
under some conditions, Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) or even organic farming for some 
crops could help save water and chemical fertilisers. It is also important to recognise 
that India has achieved relative self-sufficiency in basic staples and has emerged as the 
largest exporter of rice in the world (almost 40 per cent of world exports in 2022-23). 
Exporting 20 MT of rice means at least exporting 40 billion cubic meters of water. At 
home, the Food Corporation of India currently has rice stocks that are more than three 
times the buffer stock norm. Excessive production of rice results from large subsidies for 
power for irrigation, water, and fertilisers. The time has come to promote ‘crop-neutral 
incentive structures.’ That would imply that pulses, oilseeds, and millets that save on 
power, water, and fertilisers need to be rewarded with equivalent subsidies embedded 
in rice production. 
Further, the need of the hour is to move from basic food security to nutritional security. We 
need more pulses, millet, fruits and vegetables, milk and meat for that. Importantly, their 
demand is growing much faster than that of basic staples. So, farm sector policies should 
align more with a ‘demand-driven food system’ that is more nutritious and aligned with 
Nature’s resource endowments.  
In sum, there is a need to take a holistic view of these diverse considerations, such that 
economic policies, in general, and farm policies, in particular, benefit farmers and are 
compatible with priorities related to health, water, and climate.
Given India’s natural competitive advantages, agriculture and allied sectors have immense 
scope to contribute to employment and economic growth. Policies that enhance the economic 
viability of farming, ensure food and nutritional security, and place it on an economically, 
climatically, and environmentally sustainable footing will attract private sector investment

Medium Term Outlook
171
and pave the way for higher value addition by the sector while allowing public resources to 
be deployed in health, education, and skilling. 
Hence, striving to achieve consensus with wide stakeholder consultations on the various 
issues in the sector is a multi-bagger in terms of the economic and social returns on the 
investment of effort.
5.29.	 Strategy to secure the financing of green transition in India: Given the climate financing 
needs confronting India, there is a need to exploit the rapidly growing pool of global green 
capital from sovereign wealth funds, global pensions, private equity, and infrastructure funds. 
Ways to do so include addressing barriers to investment in transition projects, fostering a 
sustainable finance ecosystem, and diversifying funding sources. There is also the need for 
innovative and tailored approaches to effectively channel funds into green finance. For instance, 
blended finance, which strategically integrates public and private capital, holds the potential 
to attract private sector involvement, mitigate investment risks, and enable the rapid and 
scalable deployment of resources needed to successfully transition to a sustainable, low-carbon 
economy. Furthermore, as India shifts to low-carbon energy to meet its environmental goals, 
sector-specific financial institutions can also help to mobilize green funds. Their specialized 
knowledge of the sector (especially the hard-to-abate sector) enables them to create innovative 
financial products tailored to transition projects’ unique requirements. By directing investment 
to green initiatives, these institutions can drive the transition to cleaner energy, contributing 
not only to reducing carbon emissions but also to a more sustainable and resilient energy future. 
There is significant potential for enhancing the role of the International Financial Services 
Centres Authority (IFSCA) which can act as a conduit for attracting international capital crucial 
to fill India’s climate finance gap. The Report on Transition Finance by the Expert Committee 
on Climate Finance has submitted their recommendations which can provide a roadmap for 
IFSCA to develop a climate finance ecosystem and instruments. India also can engage with 
multilateral development banks and explore the use of new and existing instruments that they 
have to offer to raise necessary finance which can be ploughed back into financing India’s green 
transition goals. 
Box V.4: Leveraging Market Finance: India’s Catalytic Use of 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
India’s economic trajectory towards higher middle-income status is reflected in how the 
country is evolving in its use of development finance from the World Bank Group.  As a 
founding member of the World Bank, India became the dominant user of the International 
Development Association (IDA) – the primary source of concessionary financing from the 
World Bank.  With increasing income growth, India graduated from the IDA concessionary 
financing to accessing funding through the World Bank’s more commercial IBRD window 
and, in the process, becoming a contributor to IDA.  As India begins to approach the 
borrowing limits for an IBRD country and given the planned investments in human capital, 
climate transition, and infrastructure, the country now needs to again shift its approach on 
how to best use multilateral finance. Today India needs to access market finance at scale to 
fuel its economic growth.  In this context, India is drawing on the Multilateral Investment

Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group to directly access financial markets on 
competitive terms by using the multilateral as a mechanism to leverage market finance in 
addition to drawing on its traditional role as a lender of multilateral finance.
Two MIGA guarantee operations have already been completed this fiscal year.  MIGA provided 
a credit enhancement guarantee to Japan’s MUFG investment bank for their commercial loan 
of $100 million to the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL).  
It will enable DFCCIL to complete the Ludhiana-Khurja and Kanpur-Mughalsarai sections 
of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC), and the last mile connectivity between 
the freight corridor and multimodal logistics terminals. The commercial finance is being 
executed through GIFT City in Gujarat, where MUFG has opened a centre. In addition, 
MIGA provided credit enhancement guarantees to Citi, Standard Chartered Bank, and 
Credit Agricole for their commercial loans totalingtotaling US$200 million, which was used 
to partially replace an existing US$500 million IBRD loan to the State Bank of India (SBI). 
The IBRD loan was provided to SBI in 2016 as part of the Grid Connected Solar Rooftop22 
Program to deliver rooftop solar systems to commercial and industrial customers across 
India. 
Both operations reflect India’s commitment to a green, economic growth strategy.  The 
freight corridor is a much more efficient mode of transportation relative to road transport 
and reduces millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) each year.  The SBI’s 
financing of solar PV program provides clean, renewable energy and reduces greenhouse gas 
emissions by displacing thermal generation.  For both programs, India used IBRD loans to 
finance the early phase of infrastructure development – allowing the operations to become 
commercially bankable – before replacing it with market financing backed by MIGA.  In 
effect, IBRD investment helped the infrastructure investments cross the green-field risks, 
making the MIGA-backed market financing competitive with IBRD and, at the same time, 
allowing IBRD funds to be released for reinvestment in new development projects.   The 
MIGA guarantee allowed DFCCIL to borrow internationally under commercial terms for the 
first time, thereby diversifying the SOE’s financing options.  For SBI, the guarantees also 
reduced its cost of borrowing and diversified its sources of funding.  Importantly, in using 
MIGA, India is following one of the main recommendations of the report written under 
its G-20 Presidency, calling for the World Bank Group to play a greater role in leveraging 
market finance for middle-income countries.    
5.30.	 Strategy towards bridging the education-employment gap: Skill development 
is at the centre of changes happening in education and labour markets amid the global 
megatrends, such as automation, action against climate change, the digitalisation of products 
and services, which are changing the nature of work and skills demands. With one of the youngest 
populations, a median age of 28, India can harness its demographic dividend by nurturing a 
workforce that is equipped with employable skills and prepared for the needs of the industry. 
Elevated levels and superior standards of skills help countries adeptly navigate the challenges 
and opportunities present in both domestic and international job markets. India has not only

recognised the potential of its young workforce but also the issues associated with skilling such 
a vast population. The National Policy on Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) 
focuses on bridging gaps, improving industry engagement, establishing a quality assurance 
framework, leveraging technology, and expanding apprenticeship opportunities. Prioritising 
equity, it targets marginalised groups and emphasises skill development and entrepreneurship 
for women. In the entrepreneurial domain, the policy educates potential entrepreneurs, 
facilitates mentorship, fosters innovation, enhances ease of doing business, and promotes 
social entrepreneurship. This, in combination with the National Education Policy (NEP), holds 
tremendous potential for bridging the education-employment gap in India. However, skills are 
acquired on the foundations built by the education system, especially at the schools. Therefore, 
schooling should focus on the basic requirement of foundational literacy and numeracy and the 
realisation of grade-appropriate learning outcomes. The NEP 2020 and NEP 2023 provides a 
good framework to realise this objective. It serves as a stimulus for reforming the educational 
system to increase the employability of the future generation. Implementing the NEP is key to 
achieving educational outcomes and preparing the youth for participating in the knowledge 
economy. In addition, new skilling initiatives and revamping the existing skilling initiatives 
should continue to be of high priority to the Government. The industry itself has much to gain 
from taking the initiative on this matter with academic institutions rather than leaving it only 
up to the governments – union and states – to do the heavy lifting. Indeed, it should be the 
other way around.
5.31.	 Strategy towards building state capacity and capability: Since 2014, India has 
made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit 
schemes aimed at enhancing citizens’ well-being. The civil service has been at the heart of these 
transformative efforts. The civil service's ability to design policies and ensure that initiatives 
reach all citizens has been critical to the success of these programs. However, sustaining and 
accelerating India's progress in the face of evolving challenges requires the state machinery 
to reimagine, reinvent, reinvigorate, and re-equip itself. After eighty years of relative stability 
post-WW II, it appears that convulsive change is in store in global affairs. It is unlikely to leave 
too many areas untouched – diplomacy, security, and domestic socio-economic development. 
At senior levels, the country will need the combined wisdom, knowledge and experience of 
both the generalists and specialists. Civil Service provides the former and the private sector 
the latter. In recent years, the Government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry 
into the senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process. This needs to be 
substantially expanded. It is one way to plug the gap because the need for diverse skills and 
mindsets will only keep expanding in the coming years. Foundational and mid-career training 
for civil servants in all specialities has to be re-imagined for the recharging and rebooting of 
skills, aptitude and attitudes. Length of tenure too is critical to grow into the demands of, 
and be productive and purposeful, in senior roles. Accountability mechanisms and practices 
will become necessary, if not already, to ensure policy outcomes at scale and speed. Annual 
conversations on goals and measurement – at the beginning and the end of the year – at senior 
levels will usher in professionalism and accountability. While, in theory, the desirability of 
such a practice is not in doubt, these mechanisms and practices will themselves require many 
iterations for a better understanding of their feasibility, limitations, and utility to evolve before 
they are institutionalised more permanently.

Box V. 5: Mission Karmayogi’s holistic approach to building 
state capacity in India
The First and Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) reports had identified 
several barriers to improved capacity of the civil service. These included departments 
implementing policies in silos,23 poor communication, strict information boundaries, and 
lack of collaboration which resulted in duplicate efforts and inefficient resource allocation.24 
Undergirding this structure was a personnel management system that hampered the capacity 
and motivation of civil servants to work efficiently. Under-resourced training institutes 
and infrequently updated training programs did not provide officials with the skills and 
specialisation they needed to grow professionally and meet the changing needs of public 
administration.25,26 Performance management systems were not equipped with the proper 
mechanisms to assess, reward, and improve performance, and to align officials’ capacities 
with the needs of the system.27 Challenging work environments and lack of mentorship led 
to reduced motivation to excel at work.28 
Addressing these problems has required looking beyond a single, definitive solution. In their 
seminal paper on the challenges of policy-making in diverse societies, Rittel and Webber 
(1973) propose that problems of public policy planning are ‘wicked’: they are inherently 
complex, multi-faceted, and resistant to straightforward solutions.29 hey comprise multiple 
smaller problems and concern multiple actors, often with competing priorities. There is no 
clear point at which a problem of this nature can be said to be solved and no ideal solution 
for it. The government has responded to the wicked challenge of building state capacity by 
launching Mission Karmayogi, which deconstructs the problem into more tractable sub-
components. The program endeavours to enhance state capacity using the ‘Workforce-
Work-Workplace’ framework to address each level of the civil service as well as the linkages 
and interactions between them.30 It provides a multi-pronged solution encompassing:
	
Building the capacity of the Workforce centred on their roles and associated 
competency requirements at multiple career stages 
	
Improving the quality of the Work through role-based human resource management 
and decision-making 
	
Enhancing the Workplace through mentorship, better managerial practices, and 
improved physical infrastructure

By connecting workplace roles and workers’ competencies, Mission Karmayogi builds a 
much-needed bridge between capacity building and human resource management systems. 
Competencies are the attitudes, skills, and knowledge that are essential for a civil servant 
to perform their role successfully. As officials evolve in their careers, the competencies 
they are required to possess also evolve. Through Mission Karmayogi, the government is 
delineating the competency requirements for all civil servants in terms of their roles and 
duties, as well as the four Gunas or overarching virtues of civil servants as highlighted in the 
Karmayogi Competency Model.31 Competencies then become a key tool for enhancing the 
performance of civil servants. Once competencies have been specified, they can be assessed 
using several measures, including workplace performance assessments, data from digital 
MIS systems, and 360-degree feedback mechanisms. This would enable the government to 
provide calibrated capacity-building support and identify the right person for the right role 
in government.
Capacity-building programmes, both in terms of pre-service training and ongoing professional 
development, can be designed to build the specific competencies that a civil servant needs to 
perform their role well. This also creates the space to expand beyond conventional training 
programs to draw on a range of approaches that are grounded in evidence-based adult 
learning principles, such as immersion programs, exposure visits, case studies (through the 
use of Amrit Gyaan Kosh32), and self-paced and technology-enabled learning. To achieve 
this at scale, technology-enabled capacity building will allow officials across cadres, states, 
and seniority to steer their professional development. The iGOT Karmayogi platform is 
rapidly shaping into a central node that enables civil servants to access tailored and need-
based capacity-building modules, track their competency requirements and gaps, and share 
knowledge and learnings across departments.
In tandem with capacity building, Mission Karmayogi is also introducing a role-based 
human resource management system that would allow the government to match civil 
servants with roles based on the competencies they possess and the requirements of the 
role. Decision-making around postings, transfers, and promotions can then be guided by 
civil servants’ demonstrated competencies and experience. This is a significant shift from 
the current rule-based approach, which will generate better incentives for performance 
among civil servants. Access to the universe of capacity-building resources - and not just 
what is considered relevant for their level - will enable civil servants to proactively plan their 
professional journeys within government in a manner that aligns with their areas of interest 
and expertise.
31  The Karmayogi Competency Model is a public human resource management framework developed by the 
Capacity Building Commission of India. The framework is built on four elements: self-awareness of one’s own 
strengths and weaknesses, collaboration and inclusion of diverse voices towards a shared goal, transparency and 
compliance with the rules and regulation as well as Knowledge of systems and processes, and citizen-centricity 
and the motivation to transform citizens’ lives through one’s work.
32 Developed by the Capacity Building Commission of India, Amrit Gyaan Kosh is a dedicated knowledge bank for 
civil servants which houses teachable case studies, policy simulations, and interactive and immersive learning 
resources.

Economic Survey 2023-24

Civil servants with enhanced capacities and improved fit for their roles will constitute high-
performing and efficient teams. This will be accompanied by investments in building great 
workplaces for civil servants, characterised by a culture of motivation, shared purpose, and 
trust, and supported by stronger knowledge management systems. Senior civil servants 
will provide mentorship and guidance to early-career civil servants. Some of this is already 
happening in pockets but these practices will be more widely institutionalised. Upgrades 
to physical infrastructure will also support civil servants to boost their performance, 
while technology-enabled workplaces will improve efficiency and collaboration. Further, 
technological infrastructure, data, and workflow systems will strengthen institutional 
memory, providing a knowledge base to plan and implement a long-term vision for the 
social and economic performance of the nation.
OUTLOOK IN THE MEDIUM TERM
5.32.	 The Indian growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience. The country 
has weathered the onslaught of multiple global crises because the government dealt with them 
deftly by forging a recovery strategy that was uniquely designed to address the concerns of 
citizens while ensuring that the growth momentum continued to be sustained through a wide 
range of structural reforms. India’s strength has always been its institutions, and, many a time, 
the institutional strength has enabled the country to wade through multiple challenges. 
5.33.	 The structural reforms undertaken by the Government of India over the course of the 
last decade have put the economy firmly on a growth path, thanks to which India is soon set 
to become the third largest economy in the world, following the US and China. In its April 
2024 World Economic Outlook, the IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.8 
per cent from 6.5 per cent on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age 
population, making India the fastest-growing G20 economy. It is in line with our expectations 
for economic growth, as mentioned in Chapter 1. India has graduated from being a low-income 
country to a low-middle-income country. As it journeys further towards middle and upper-
middle-income status, aspirations of the people keep rising. Satisfaction with past progress 
fades away from memory quickly, and newer expectations take their place. The measurement 
of achievements in the present against rising aspirations leaves society appear restless and 
discontented. But, this is creative and not destructive. The latent energy of such aspirations 
needs to be harnessed even as they have to be met. This has to be carried out in a country 
of India’s size and within a democratic framework. There are no historical precedents and 
templates to follow for the complexity it entails. What has brought the economy to its present 
state from where it was three decades ago may not take us to the next destination. Awareness 
of the unique nature of India’s circumstances and its goals is necessary to prepare ourselves to 
participate in and contribute to its socio-economic progress. Our knowledge and attitudes have 
to continually evolve to keep up with the requirements that the project, ‘Viksit Bharat @2047’ 
entails. Open minds are a good place to start.
5.34.Given the above, the present chapter presents a six-pronged growth strategy premised on 
the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of

the economy, have to give way to next-gen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, 
sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Primary amongst these strategies is to ensure that 
capital formation in the private sector grows organically and steadily, delivering endogenous 
growth in jobs and a fair share of income for workers. Second, financing green transition for 
India is an area where public-private partnerships will be critical. There need to be innovative 
financing instruments that can help mobilise private capital towards India’s transition efforts. 
Third, as far as MSMEs are concerned while bridging the credit gap remains a crucial element, 
the focus also needs to be on deregulation, enhancing physical and digital connectivity, and 
putting in place an export strategy that enables MSMEs to broaden their market exposure and 
scale up. Fourth, the potential of agriculture to be an engine of growth, development, and equity 
has to be exploited through intelligent farmer-friendly policies that are environmentally and 
climatically sustainable. Fifth, India’s education policies and skill policies should adopt a laser-
like focus on learning and skilling outcomes and need to be aligned with each other, as well. 
We can draw lessons from global experiences on how this could be achieved, such as the EU 
Cohesion Policy33. Lastly, enhancing state capacity and capability is critical to ensure that the 
growth strategy suggested in this chapter achieves fruition. Sustaining and accelerating India's 
progress in the face of evolving challenges requires dedicated investment in state machinery to 
reinvent and reinvigorate itself. 
5.35.	 In Chapter 2 of ‘The Indian Economy: A Review’, published in January 2024, we wrote 
that there was considerable scope for the economy to grow at or above 7 per cent on a sustained 
basis if we could build on the structural reforms undertaken since 2014. The strengthening of 
the banking system, the creation of an Insolvency and bankruptcy framework, the institution 
of a nationwide Goods and Services Tax, and the expansion of the country’s physical and digital 
infrastructure are but a few of them. The strategies presented in this Chapter seek to build on 
these policy initiatives.
5.36.	 The new government at the helm of affairs signifies continuity as well as change as India 
progresses towards the collective goal of ViksitBharat@2047. As envisioned by Prime Minister 
Modi, “We need to walk the roadmap of progress, and it won't be solely determined by the 
government; the nation will shape it. Every citizen will have to give his input and actively 
participate in it. ‘Sabka Prayas’, meaning everyone's effort, is a mantra that turns the biggest 
resolutions into reality. Whether it's the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Digital India campaign, 
dealing with COVID-19, or the idea of Vocal for Local, we have all witnessed the power of 
‘Sabka Prayas’. It is through ‘Sabka Prayas’ that a ‘Viksit Bharat’ will materialise34.”
33 Education, training and lifelong learning remain a priority in the 2021-2027 period in EU cohesion policy. 
Overall, EUR 33.6 billion of EU planned allocations have been allocated to measures directly targeting education, 
training and skills development. The combination and coordination of measures supported by these funds will 
allow Member States and regions to strengthen their efforts towards more inclusive and quality education 
and training systems in an integrated manner, as well as support reforms in these areas, https://tinyurl.com/

CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
ENERGY TRANSITION: 
DEALING WITH TRADE-
OFFS
Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies in the World, India’s annual per 
capita carbon emission is only about one-third of the global average. India envisions a 
'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, which translates to 'Developed India'. This vision and the goal 
of achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 guide the country’s interventions for 
high and robust economic growth, which is inclusive and environmentally sustainable. 
Access to stable energy at a reasonable cost at a pace required to power ambitious 
targets while on a low-carbon pathway is a sine quo non for development. This task 
is a challenge, considering that cleaner and greener energy sources require viable 
battery storage technologies and access to critical minerals to allow these sources to be 
stable energy suppliers. Balancing development needs with a low-carbon pathway is a 
tightrope, especially when financed predominantly through domestic resources.
INTRODUCTION
6.1.	
Since the last Economic Survey was written, there has been no dearth of conferences, 
meetings, and summits dedicated to climate change. It continues to dominate policy and 
other discourses around the world. It provides a ready-made topic for think tanks, experts, 
and policy wonks to appear suitably concerned. However, the world is realising what experts 
and policymakers in advanced nations are resisting - that its current approach to dealing with 
climate change is flawed for one very simple reason. It continues to ignore trade-offs. But 
practical men and women have been unable to avoid recognising trade-offs. Countries had to 
push back their own timelines.
6.2.	
The United Kingdom postponed its decision to ban the sale of vehicles that run on petrol 
and diesel for five years from 2030 to 2035. Germany had to dilute its rules for banning boilers 
running on fossil fuels before they could be passed. The rise of alternative political parties 
in developed nations is attributed to the public's resistance to climate-related rules that are 
perceived as unfairly targeting the poor and low-income by raising their cost of living. According 
to Bloomberg, German businesses cite rising energy costs as the single biggest reason for 
relocating out of the country1. That is the crux of the challenge that governments are grappling with.
6.3.	
Alternative energy sources require fiscal subsidies to be affordable. However, most 
governments worldwide are fiscally stretched, especially after dealing with the economic and

health dislocations caused by the pandemic. Many countries also tax fossil fuels heavily. By 
clamping down on their usage, governments will lose those revenues. Geopolitically, the thrust 
on renewable energy and electric vehicles has set off a race to secure critical minerals and rare 
earths. China has positioned itself as an indispensable source of several of these materials. 
Securing supply in crunch times is a matter of concern. Nuclear energy is the cleanest and 
safest option. However, some nations are reluctant to consider it given that their public 
overestimates probabilities of rare events, as humans are wont to. Three-mile island, Chernobyl 
and Fukushima, loom large in people's minds. Prof. Daniel Kahneman, who passed away earlier 
this year, would have chuckled.2  
6.4.	
Relatively common metals like copper and nickel are going to become scarcer. In 'The 
Material World', Ed Conway wrote that the world might need more copper in the next few 
decades than it has ever used since the metal was known to humans. Not just copper but other 
metals will also be in short supply. The price of energy transition will be too much for most 
nations. It will only get worse. More importantly, extracting materials and minerals requires a 
tremendous amount of energy. Analysts in JP Morgan wrote3, "… just developing the forecasted 
wind and solar capacities would require ~10EJ of energy during 2024-30, which is equivalent 
to ~20% of our projected global energy demand growth over the same period (forecasts based 
on our Global Energy Outlook) and will emit ~1,450 mn tonnes of CO2e (~207 mn tonnes on 
average, equivalent to the annual emissions of Pakistan or Argentina in 2022). Additionally, 
the projected penetration of electric vehicles in the global light-duty vehicle fleet requires 
another ~10EJ of energy to build and charge these EVs.”
6.5.	
The other factor is time. Nowhere in the world has energy transition of this scale 
happened within the short time envisaged. Vaclav Smil wrote in 2014,4"… each widespread 
transition from one dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years…. Energy transitions 
on a national or global scale are inherently protracted affairs. The unfolding shift from 
fossil fuels to renewable energy sources will be no exception. It will require generations of 
perseverance.” In fact, he wrote that the more effective solution was to lower overall energy 
use. Alas, that is one advice that the world is either unable to or unwilling to heed. It is hard 
to fault developing countries for not wanting to curb their energy consumption. It is morally 
wrong to tell developing countries to abandon their aspirations for better living standards so 
that developed countries can maintain their ways of living in cleaner environments and cooler 
climates.
6.6.	
However, the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 did precisely that. It trumped 
the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon barely three months earlier. Professor Mike 
Hulme wrote, 5 "The goal of securing global temperature within a certain numerical range 
took precedence over a broader set of welfare ambitions, in part because of the success of

climate scientists and Government negotiators in characterising the goal of climate policies in 
terms of a single, and seemingly simple, index. Yet, …global temperature is a seriously flawed 
index for capturing the full range of complex relationships between climate and human 
welfare and ecological integrity.”
6.7.	
Not only have development goals been downgraded in the process of elevation of 
containing global emissions to the pinnacle of all economic policies, but developing nations are 
also being threatened with a carbon tax at the border, in full negation of the spirit of common 
but differentiated responsibilities and respective national capabilities that was supposed to 
have undergirded the Paris Agreement.
6.8.	
It would be a comedy if it were not real and tragic. Even as developed nations prepare to 
impose a carbon tax at the border on imports coming into their countries laden with carbon, 
they are ramping up energy demand like never before, thanks to their obsession with letting 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) guide, take over and dominate natural intelligence. One of the 
leading global technology companies promised to achieve Net Zero by 2030 at the turn of 
the decade. But, the race to dominate the emerging technology of Artificial Intelligence has 
caused its emissions to be higher by 30 per cent by 2023. In a research report6 published in 
April, analysts in Goldman Sachs wrote that the demand for power in the United States would 
experience a growth not seen in a generation, thanks to AI and that "transmission, one of the 
major bottlenecks for clean energy transition, and the addition of data centres and AI could 
exacerbate this". This and other issues pertaining to managing energy demand as a sensible 
way of dealing with climate change are examined intensely and analysed forensically in Chapter 
13 in a special essay.
6.9.	
However, these developments should convince any reasonable reader that the developed 
world has not only tied itself into knots but is also contributing – wittingly or otherwise – 
to deepening and entrenching poverty and inequality in developing and consigning them to 
perpetual underdeveloped status by coercing them into prioritising emissions over their 
economies. Developed countries, having relied on a fossil fuel-based growth strategy for 
the past two centuries to reach where they are today, seek ambitious cuts in emissions from 
developing countries, pushing them to adopt policy measures, instruments and production and 
energy systems that are distinctly different from the carbon-emitting traditional strategies that 
fuelled the growth of the former. The fact that these novel pathways are untested or trusted is 
apparent from the recent deliberations of the G7 countries on ending the use of unabated coal 
power plants only in the first half of 2030,7 even when their carbon emissions peaked several 
decades ago. Japan and Germany did not agree to this. In contrast, Germany has written into 
its legislation a final target to shut coal plants by 2038, while Japan has yet to set a date. This is 
a recipe for intra and international conflicts.8

6.10.	 The impact of climate change will affect developing countries disproportionately because 
these countries are already vulnerable and less resilient and must prioritise their economic 
development needs. Though not part of the problem, developing countries are part of the 
solution. Developing countries have already accepted the need for ambitious greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction, as evidenced by their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), on the 
condition that the developed countries provide resources at a reasonable cost. Incorporating the 
impact of climate change into the development model, also called the low-carbon development 
pathways, requires access to technology and financial resources in the order of trillions of 
dollars. Even by conservative standards, the estimate of resource requirement (considering 
that not all the needs have been costed) ranges between USD 5.8 - 11.5 trillion till 20309. With 
financial resources and technology not reaching developing countries at the desired pace, 
quantity, or terms, economic growth, and prosperity, albeit sustainably, will equip developing 
countries with the strength to address climate change.
6.11.	 Globally, recognising trade-offs is critical to bringing climate goals into the realm of 
feasibility and acceptability. To recognise trade-offs, we need to be  able to ask the right and, 
more importantly, honest questions.
6.12.	 One such question is “Is imagining a world without climate change all that useful? It 
almost goes without saying that if we could keep the benefits of fossil-fuelled industrialisation 
and jettison the negative side effects of climate change, we would do so. But what makes 
decision-making so thorny is that for most climate-sensitive societal outcomes….the net effect 
of fossil-fuelled industrialisation and technological change has been good…Thus, “without 
climate change” is not always the most relevant hypothetical counterfactual, and often 
“without fossil-fuelled industrialisation and technological progress” is more relevant. This 
framing gives a more honest and holistic picture of the state of the climate change problem, and 
it does not misleadingly paint the current systems as being less attractive than they actually 
are. When we assess the best course of action going forward, we must compare alternative 
systems and weigh the benefits of avoided climate change against the costs of transitioning

and forthright on the trade-offs we face.”10 
6.13.	 Fittingly, the last word of this introductory section should be left to Mike Hulme, who 
has been studying the phenomenon for more than four decades:
"Climate change isn't everything. It is quite easy to imagine future worlds in which global 
temperature exceeds 2°C warming which are 'better' for human well-being, political stability 
and ecological integrity, for example, than other worlds in which – by all means and at all 
costs – global temperature was stabilised at 1.5°C."
6.14.	 As for India, despite the challenges mentioned above, managing the impact of climate 
change while ensuring that developmental priorities continue to get the focus has been the 
hallmark of its growth strategy. The chapter reviews India's initiatives and performance in

addressing climate change, discusses energy transition issues, and deliberates upon the status 
of the multilateral negotiations. The chapter ends by exploring the options and the way forward
PRESENT STATUS OF INDIA’S CLIMATE ACTION
6.15.	 India has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change. The National 
Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)11  outlines the strategy to enhance the sustainability 
of the country’s development path. Based on the principles of achieving high economic growth 
while also improving the ecological sustainability of India's developmental path, NAPCC 
includes nine national missions covering solar, water, energy efficiency, forests, sustainable 
habitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, strategic knowledge for 
climate change, and the recently added mission on human health. A broad spectrum of climate 
action - adaptation and mitigation, including demand side management - is being taken through 
the programme. States and Union Territories (UTs) have been encouraged to prepare their 
State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with strategies in the NAPCC.  So far, 
34 SAPCCs are operational, laying out sector-specific and cross-sectoral, time-bound priority 
actions for the state. 
6.16.	 India has made significant progress on climate action. The addition to the installed solar 
power capacity was 15.03 GW in 2023-24, reaching a cumulative of 82.64 GW on 30 April 
2024.12 Under the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, the eighth cycle of the 
Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme13 was notified in June 2023 for the period 2023-
24 to 2025-26 and covers sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Iron & Steel, Pulp 
& Paper, and Textile with a total energy saving target of 0.3370 MTOE (million tonnes of oil 
equivalent). The PAT scheme in its various cycles has resulted in a significant amount of energy 
savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Box 2).
6.17.	 As a result of the coordinated action, most targets of the first NDC were achieved well in 
advance. For instance, the country achieved 40 per cent cumulative electrical power installed 
capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021 and reduced the emission intensity 
of India’s GDP from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019– nine and eleven years before the 
target year of 2030, respectively. The NDC was further updated in August 2022.14  The target to 
reduce the emissions intensity of India’s GDP was enhanced to 45 per cent (from the earlier 33-
35 per cent) by 2030 from the 2005 level, and the target on cumulative electric power installed 
capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources increased to 50 per cent (earlier 40 per 
cent) by 2030. As of 31 May 2024, the share of non-fossil sources in the installed electricity

generation capacity has reached 45.4 per cent.15 India is on track to make an additional carbon 
sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030, with a carbon sink of 1.97 
billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent having already been created from 2005 to 2019.  
6.18.	 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
must periodically submit National Communication (NC) with information on their greenhouse 
gas emissions, their vulnerability to climate change, and the measures they are taking to 
mitigate emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. India submitted its Third 
National Communication (TNC),16 including India’s first Adaptation Communication (AC),17 
to the UNFCCC in December 2023. India’s TNC mentions that the energy sector contributed 
the most to the overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81 per cent, followed by the agriculture 
sector at 13.44 per cent, Industrial Process & Product Use (IPPU) at 8.41 per cent, and waste at 
2.34 per cent. It also mentions that the Land Use, Land-Use Change & Forestry (LULUCF) sector 
remained a net sink in 2019, accounting for removing 4,85,472 GgCO2e18  emissions. Considering 
total emissions and removals, India’s net national emissions in 2019 were 26,46,556 GgCO2e. 
6.19.	 The plethora of cross-sectoral measures taken in the economy and the several schemes 
to modify consumer and producer behaviour and promote energy saving have resulted in 
India’s total national emissions (including LULUCF) increasing by 4.56 per cent since 2016, 
which compares favourably with the growth experienced by the country. Interestingly, India’s 
GDP between 2005 and 2019 has grown with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 
about seven per cent, whereas the emissions grew at a CAGR of about four per cent. i.e., the 
rate of emissions growth is lower than the rate of growth of our GDP. This shows that India 
has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, reducing 
the emission intensity of its GDP. A recent report by the International Finance Corporation 
recognises India’s efforts to achieve committed climate actions, highlighting that it is the only 
G20 nation in line with 2-degree centigrade warming.19 Notably, these outcomes have been 
achieved primarily through domestic resources,20 which have predominantly formed the basis 
of India’s climate action. Given the financing needs, estimated at USD 2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 
prices) for meeting the NDC targets till 2030, access to finance and technology at a reasonable 
cost, including from the developed countries, as mandated by  the UNFCCC and its Paris 
Agreement, is essential to ease the constraint on the required resources.
ADAPTATION IS CRITICAL FOR INDIA

vulnerability to climate change's current or expected impacts, like weather extremes and

hazards, slow onset events such as sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, or food and water insecurity. 
Lower-income countries are particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts of climate change. 
According to a meta-analysis of several empirical growth studies by Richard Tol (2024),22 
the welfare-equivalent income loss due to a 2.5 °C warming relative to pre-industrial times 
is significantly higher for lower-income countries. Wealth accords a buffer that can mitigate 
the adverse effects of climate change through resilient infrastructure, adequate healthcare 
coverage, and access to adaptive technologies, allowing high-income countries to withstand 
better and adapt to the challenges posed by a warming climate. In contrast, lower-income 
countries that need to achieve their development priorities face high opportunity costs. Lack 
of resources makes them more susceptible to increased vulnerability and potential economic 
disruption. Economic growth enhances the ability of a country to take adaptation action and 
builds resilience. Therefore, from a developing country’s perspective, continued economic 
growth is the best insurance against climate change.  
6.21.	 India is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries;23 there is a greater need for 
adaptive strategies in agriculture and conservation efforts to mitigate the detrimental effects 
of climate change on natural habitats, vegetation, and vital bio-resources. The Government of 
India has taken several initiatives to address this. Much of the emphasis in the NAPCC has been 
on adaptation, with seven of the nine missions addressing it. Further, the promotion of micro 
irrigation under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), the introduction of 
the National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) to enhance the resilience 
of Indian agriculture to climate change and climate vulnerability through strategic research 
and technology demonstration, flood forecasting and early warning system, etc. are some 
significant initiatives in this direction. India’s adaptation-relevant action also includes steps 
taken to improve resilience in the economy through developmental programs such as Swachh 
Bharat Mission, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, Pradhan Mantri 
Awas Yojana, Saubhagya Scheme, etc., to name a few. 
6.22.	 The Initial Adaptation Communication of India estimates that the total adaptation-
relevant expenditure was 5.60 per cent of the GDP in 2021-2022, growing from a share of 3.7 per 
cent in 2015-16, indicating integration of climate resilience and adaptation into development 
plans. This reflects the importance that the Government is placing on adaptation action and, 
at the same time, is reflective of the significant pressure on domestic resources.  An increase in 
adaptation finance flows to India would ease the resource constraint and enable the country to 
meet its long-term sustainable development and economic growth objectives.
6.23.	 Coastal regions in India are more vulnerable to climate change. Wetland conservation 
can be an important adaptation measure in such regions. They provide a buffer and other 
coping strategies to protect against storm surges and flooding. Urban wetlands can help absorb 
excess rainfall, protecting cities. Moreover, mangroves are a natural coastal barrier that traps 
sediment and prevents coastal erosion, which strengthens the shoreline. In addition, many 
wetlands sustain local communities by supporting fisheries, agriculture, livestock, and the

production of fuel. They are a part of the solution to food security issues that may be affected 
by climate change. India has, therefore, adopted wetland and mangrove conservation as a 
priority. Since 2014, 56 new wetlands across the country have been designated as Ramsar sites 
(wetlands of international importance), taking the total number to 82 and covering an area of 
about 1.33 million ha. The Government of India announced the ‘Amrit Dharohar’ initiative as 
part of the Budget announcement 2023 to promote nature tourism in the conserved Ramsar 
sites, with the view to generating better appreciation for the value of conserving and enabling 
enhancement of job opportunities.  The Mission Sahbhagita is another milestone step towards 
participatory conservation and wise use of wetlands to enable a societal ownership approach 
with communities leading at the forefront. The Mission envisages the preparation of wetland 
health cards, ground-truthing of wetlands against the satellite-based data, and promoting the 
concept of 'Wetland Mitras' by engaging women, youth, local communities, and the private 
sector in this work.
Box VI.1: Case Study on Micro Irrigation- Role of Community-led 
Water Governance24 
Navanagar is a small agricultural village in Himmatnagar taluka of Sabarkantha District, 
Gujarat. Over the years, due to farming practices, the village's water table decreased to 500-
600 feet below the ground level. Total Dissolved Salt (TDS), ranging from 900 to 1100 mg/
litre, made the water unsuitable for agriculture. Due to these reasons, farming became a loss-
making profession for the farmers. Farmers could only produce one conventional crop like 
cotton & castor. The Water Resource Department, Gujarat, and Gujarat Green Revolution 
Company (GGRC) mobilised local farmers to rejuvenate the village pond by drawing water 
from the nearby sub-minor canal of the Guhai Dam. 
The village farmers’ co-operative society under the ‘Som Sarovar’, deepened the village 
pond with the help of the Gram Panchayat to store and conserve water. The farmers built 
a sump (40 ft diameter x 40 ft depth), drew water from the village pond, took individual 
electricity connections, and installed water lifting facilities (pump & motor) from the sump. 
The farmers bore the total cost of electrical connections and pumping/lifting of water. 
Farmers also created the piped water conveyance from the sump to their respective fields. 
The farmers’ body made it compulsory for all the member farmers to adopt drip irrigation for 
efficient water use under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC). Since then, agriculture productivity 
has seen a revival with an increase of 30 per cent along with a reduction in fertilizer and 
power consumption and crop diversification away from conventional crops like wheat, 
castor, cotton, etc., to fruits & vegetables like watermelon, musk-melon, fennel, cumin and 
chilly that are more remunerative. Water governance by the community transformed the 
village from water deficient to water sufficient, ensuring equity in water distribution.

LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT25 AND ENERGY COMPOSITION
Energy Composition and Efficiency
6.24.	 India’s energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047 to meet a growing 
economy's developmental priorities and aspirations.26 Considering that resources are limited, 
the pace of energy transition would need to factor in alternative demands on the resources for 
improving resilience to climate change and for sustained social and economic development. 
Achieving Net Zero by 2070 requires an orderly transition to a diversified mix of energy sources 
with a significant share of non-fossils and enhancement in energy production and usage 
efficiency. Phasing renewable energy into the country's energy mix is paramount in India’s 
drive towards cleaner energy sources.  
6.25.	 India’s primary energy mix in 2022-23 was fossil-fuel dominant, with almost 84 per 
cent met from coal, oil, and natural gas combined (Figure 1). However, the composition in the 
electricity sector has significantly changed due to the phasing in of renewables, with the share 
of non-fossil power capacity being 45.4 per cent as of May 2024 from around 32 per cent in 
April 2014.27 Recent initiatives for enhancing the production of renewables are noteworthy. 
First, PM-Surya Ghar Yojana, launched in February 2024 with a total outlay of ₹75,021 Crore, 
is expected to add 30 GW of solar capacity and reduce 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 
creating around 17 lakh direct jobs across the solar value chain.28 Second, given India’s 7,600 
km long coastline, the Government has notified the national offshore wind energy policy 
and offshore wind energy lease rules, 2023.29 Several offshore zones have been identified 
for harnessing this potential, and viability gap funding for an initial capacity of one gigawatt 
has been announced recently.30 Third, underscoring the importance of green hydrogen in 
reducing carbon emissions in the hard-to-abate sectors, India’s Green Hydrogen Mission 
targets five MMT of green hydrogen by 2030.31  The scheme offers financial incentives to boost 
electrolyser manufacturing and production. The tender for selecting green hydrogen producers 
& electrolyser manufacturers under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition 
(SIGHT) scheme has been awarded for a total capacity of 4,12,000 tons.32 
6.26.	 India’s ambitious green hydrogen production target is subject to various constraints, 
including on the supply side - the cost of production and delivery, and, on the demand side - 
25 Low-carbon development is defined as a development strategy that aims at reducing emissions while ensuring 
economic development and improved welfare. It places economic development as a priority while taking 
mitigation actions that enable a reduction in emissions.

readiness to consume green hydrogen in traditional industrial processes. The electrolysers and 
renewable energy used as inputs are the two major components of green hydrogen production 
cost. The cost of capital, water supply and treatment, storage and distribution, conversion of 
hydrogen to suitable derivatives, and an enabling infrastructure would also contribute to the 
final delivered cost of green hydrogen for any particular application. As green hydrogen is 
produced using renewable energy, the sector inherits all the limitations of the renewable sector, 
including the issue of intermittency and the huge requirement of land for solar and wind energy 
generation.

6.27.	 At present, three typical features characterise India’s energy use - high use of biomass 
as a share of the total primary energy supply, predominance of imports of fossil fuel (mainly 
petroleum) and use of domestic coal for electricity generation. The high use of biomass is set 
to change significantly with the advancement of solar rooftop installations, the proliferation of 

Climate Change and Energy Transition
189
solar appliances, and the ramping up of LPG-based cooking. Petroleum (85 per cent of which 
is imported) has a diversified presence across transport, industrial sector, residential, and 
commercial, which poses a significant challenge given the volatility in oil prices and limited 
access to natural gas. 
6.28.	 Coal accounts for nearly 70 per cent of the total electric generation. It is also a critical 
input in various industries, such as steel, sponge iron, cement, and paper. Addressing the 
transition when coal is a predominant energy source, even though the Government has been 
stimulating the phasing-in of renewables, requires a sequenced movement towards cleaner coal 
and more efficient technologies. The Government has launched several clean coal initiatives, 
including the Coal Gasification Mission. It aims to gasify 100 million tonnes of coal by 2030 
through surface coal/lignite gasification projects. Adopting gasification technology in India can 
revolutionise the coal sector, reducing reliance on imports of Natural Gas, Methanol, Ammonia, 
and other essential products while reducing emissions. Initiatives such as extracting Coal Bed 
Methane (CBM) gases, exploring coal to hydrogen, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and 
coal beneficiation through washeries, etc. can mitigate emissions and enhance environmental 
sustainability. Encouragement to adopt super-critical and ultra-super-critical technologies33 
for coal power plants has also led to lower emissions and higher efficiency.

6.29.	 Policymakers recognise the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating 
clean energy transitions while supporting energy security. It may be noted that the outcome 
of the first Global Stocktake (GST) seeks to double the global average annual rate of energy 
efficiency improvements by 2030, pursued in a nationally determined manner and as per 
differing national circumstances.35 The measures taken by the country to increase energy 
efficiency are presented in Box 2. 
Box VI.2 Steps taken to improve Energy Efficiency36 
India has an ambitious target of Emissions Intensity (EI) reduction of 45 per cent by 2030 
from the base of 2005. To achieve this, absolute emissions must be restricted to around 
4584 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e). This means that the overall emissions in 
the economy would have to be reduced by 3753 MtCO2e (over the baseline scenario) to meet 
the NDC target. The sectoral breakup under the energy efficiency domain to achieve 2030 
targets is given in Figure 3.
Chart VI.3: Target emissions reductions to achieve the 
NDC commitment by 2030 (in MtCO2e)
 
Source: Based on data provided by Ministry of Power, GOI
Energy efficiency improvement in buildings and appliances is a priority for India as over 50 
per cent of the 2030 building stock is yet to come up – a situation that is fundamentally 
different from developed countries.37 A reduction in emission intensity in the building sector 
will play a key role in achieving the target. Presently, around 33 per cent of the total electricity 
consumption is in consumers' commercial and residential categories, estimated to grow to 
approximately 40 per cent of total electricity consumption by 2031-32.

The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) sets minimum energy performance 
standards for commercial buildings. A voluntary star rating program has also been launched 
for existing commercial buildings. Shunya labelling program identifies and commemorates 
Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and Net Positive Energy Buildings (NPEB). For appliances, 
the Standards and Labelling (S&L) program was launched to provide consumers with an 
informed choice about the energy and cost-saving potential of the labelled appliances/
equipment being sold commercially. As per the 2022-23 Impact Assessment report of 
BEE, the S&L program helped save 81 billion units of electricity. The Government has also 
implemented a Star-rated program to offer high-efficiency ACs for consumers, and BEE 
has designed an incentive-based market transformation program offering incentives for 
consumers to switch from ACs older than eight years to 5-star rated models.
The Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative was launched by the Prime Minister of India 
at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. It aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable 
lifestyles to address the challenges of environmental degradation and climate change. India 
has integrated several policies in its energy transition strategy that are aligned with LiFE.
Adopting energy-efficient practices is at the heart of LiFE.38 Household consumers can, 
by adopting energy-efficient appliances and buildings, sustainable mobility and virtuous 
energy management foster a widespread culture of energy efficiency. According to IEA 
analysis, adopting worldwide LiFE actions – including behavioural changes and sustainable 
consumption choices – would save consumers about USD 440 billion and amount to one-
fifth of the emissions reduction needed by 2030.  Behavioural and lifestyle changes are 
also among the pillars put forth by India during the G20 presidency's strategic plan for 
advancing energy efficiency across demand sectors by 2030. An energy-efficient lifestyle not 
only benefits individuals but also helps governments to reduce or delay new investments in 
energy infrastructure and allows for the use of that money in other investments needed in 
the country. 
In India, mission LiFE is being unfolded by BEE in three distinct phases focusing on 
individual behavioural change:
●  encouraging people to adopt simple yet effective energy-saving practices in their daily 
lives, 
●  influencing industries and markets to cater to sustainable consumption patterns and 
●  to trigger a shift in large-scale industrial and Government policies, promoting sustainable 
production and consumption.
BEE’s efficiency policies also extend to promoting behavioural change and consumer 
awareness. Mindful consumption is promoted through programmes such as the recent 
campaign on setting air conditioners at 24 °C. The AC @ 24 campaign uses an approach 
based on optimizing consumption, switching to efficient technologies, shifting to energy-
saving behaviour, and upgrading technologies.
38 Mission LiFE aims to build a mass movement to adopt sustainable lifestyles based on mindful utilisation, 
minimising waste, and making green choices, for themselves, their families, and their communities.

For the industrial sector, the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme is another measure 
of demand management that aims to reduce emissions in energy-intensive industries. For 
a particular cycle, the mechanism involves assessing Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) 
in the baseline year and projected SEC in the target year. It covers different forms of net 
energy going into the plant's boundary and products leaving it. Eight cycles of the scheme 
have been launched so far. As the next level of action, the Ministry of Power has come out 
with the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS).  
For the transport sector, fuel consumption standards and norms have been set for cars, 
heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), and others. Considering the burgeoning numbers of Electric 
Vehicles (EVs), ‘Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles – Guidelines and Standards’ 
have been notified to promote the ecosystem of charging infrastructure. 
Demand-side management (DSM) has traditionally been recognised as a significant 
intervention to reduce energy demand. It is an ultimate irony that even as developed nations 
obsess over prospective emissions from the developing world, the widespread adoption 
of artificial intelligence is going to result in the demand for power to expand to levels not 
seen in decades in America.39 The failure and unwillingness to restrain energy demand and 
the search for so-called alternative energy sources – with their much lower energy density 
compared to fossil fuels – comes with unprecedented demand for financial and other 
resources and heightened geopolitical vulnerabilities and stress. The warped priorities of 
advanced economies are sought to be achieved at the cost of legitimate economic aspirations 
in the developing world. 
In India, DSM interventions have helped utilise and reduce the peak electricity demands and 
defer high investments in generation, transmission, and distribution networks. Measures 
that enable efficiency gains can be an effective way to reduce demand.40 A few of these 
measures include energy-efficiency pump sets in agriculture, improving the efficiency of the 
local bodies' drinking and sewage water pumping systems, improving the efficiency of the 
distribution transformer network, and star rating of appliances and white goods.
The above interventions have led to significant energy savings. Total annual energy savings 
are around 51 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) – amounting to around 6.6 per cent of 
the total primary energy supply of the country. This translates to a total annual cost savings 
of approximately ₹1,94,320 Crore and an annual CO2 emissions reduction of around 306 
million tonnes. Program-specific results are as follows: The S&L Scheme has so far reduced 
emissions by approximately 60 MtCO2, while the PAT scheme reduced emissions by 110.7 
MtCO2, and the energy-efficient LED bulbs allowed a saving of 125 MtCO2.
Challenges of Energy Transition
6.30.	 Renewable energy faces intermittency and discontinuous supply, impacting grid stability 
in the absence of battery storage. Energy demand is expected to increase substantially as the 
country develops in line with the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’, and a concomitant rise in renewable

capacity may lead to a decline in base load efficiency as the supply composition changes. 
Large-scale phasing-in of renewables poses several risks41 associated with intermittency and 
dispatchability in the energy system. Addressing the issue is critical for the more significant 
deployment of renewable energy. 
6.31.	 Some estimates suggest that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE)42 of renewables 
such as solar has fallen below that of fossil fuels in several countries, including India, Brazil, 
Australia, and Italy.43 From an investor’s perspective, the LCOE represents the total cost of 
building and operating the asset per unit of electricity generated over an assumed lifetime. 
Investing in the project may be viable if the LCOE is lower than the electricity tariff. However, 
even as the LCOE for renewables has been falling, it does not reflect the total cost the economy 
faces. The metric of LCOE ignores the costs associated with intermittency and dispatchability. 
Renewable power needs to be backed up by a stable power source when the sun is not shining 
and the wind is not blowing. If the producer is not mandated to make the power dispatchable, 
then energy procurement at LCOE reflects an implicit subsidy for the producer. One way to 
resolve this is to have Round-The-Clock (RTC) renewable energy supply contracts, which allow 
the internalisation of risks related to intermittency and dispatchability.
Box VI.3: Round-the-Clock (RTC) Supply of Renewable Energy (RE)
The objective of the Round-the-Clock (RTC) supply is to match the buyer's energy demand 
curve through renewable energy power projects with energy storage systems. 
Ministry of Power issued ‘Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for 
Procurement of Firm and Dispatchable Power from Grid Connected Renewable Energy 
Power Projects with Energy Storage Systems’ in 2023 to provide a framework for Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for RTC supply. 
A few examples of the tariffs discovered during the recent round of biddings are as follows: 
●	
Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for Interstate Transmission System (ISTS)-
connected solar PV power projects were in the range of 2.6 to 2.74 ₹/kWh.44 For 
ISTS-connected wind and solar hybrid, the range was 3.43 to 3.54 ₹/kWh.45 For ISTS-
connected wind power, it was 3.18 to 3.49 ₹/kWh.46  The range was 4.64 to 5.96 ₹/
41 Risk reflects the potential inability of the energy system to deliver on its essential function – a reliable, stable, and 
sustainable supply of energy at affordable prices and social costs.
42 The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a measure of the average net present cost of electricity generation for a 
generator over its lifetime.

The examples indicate that tariffs for RTC projects are higher than those for solar and wind 
projects without energy storage, reflecting the internalisation of externalities related to 
intermittent power generation.   
RTC-RE is at a nascent stage, and its deployment faces several challenges,50 such as the 
dynamic requirements of the utilities and growing energy demands, especially in the context 
of schemes like the SAUBHAGYA scheme, agricultural feeder segregation, Time of Day (ToD) 
mechanism, promotion of solar rooftops; and those incentivising changes in consumer 
behaviour. Owing to these rapid changes, the RTC product designed for the present demand 
pattern might need to be revised later  .
●  The least cost solutions may be obtained by combining solar and wind projects from 
multiple projects spanning multiple states. This, however, poses a challenge in terms of 
arranging long-term PPAs with multiple generators, obtaining transmission access at 
multiple locations, setting up remote control centres for real-time control, etc.
●  Higher upfront costs, technology risks, longer payback periods, and limited access to 
critical and rare earth minerals required for battery storage technology also pose serious 
challenges. In this context, pump storage-based energy storage solutions can be utilised 
to reduce system costs, owing to their longer lifetimes compared to battery energy 
storage systems.
6.32.	 Many technologies required for global Net Zero are currently commercially unavailable, 
such as hydrogen-fuelled steel/cement, steel and aluminium production with CCUS51, etc. There 
is a need to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in the domains of distributed 
RE52, offshore wind, geothermal, tidal energy, biofuels, compressed biogas, green hydrogen, 
energy storage, electrolysers, and nuclear power (including Small Modular Reactors SMR53). 
Grid balancing is equally essential for grid stability and storage. Experience indicates that the

51 Carbon Capture, Utility & storage (CCUS).
52 Distributed RE refers to small-scale generation units located closer to points of use.
53  SMRs are smaller nuclear power plants (300 MWe or less) than current generation baseload plants (1,000 MWe 
or higher). These smaller, compact designs are factory-fabricated reactors that can be transported by truck or 
rail to a nuclear power site. SMR output is scalable by putting several smaller units to achieve a larger capacity. 
Synergistic deployment of such factory-manufactured, made-in-India SMRs along with medium-size 700 MWe 
Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWRs) that have been standardised and are being deployed in fleet mode 
may be a relevant strategy for rapid scale-up of nuclear power capacity in India.

innovation process takes 20 to 70 years from prototype to commercialisation.54  However, given 
the need to contain emissions within the next three decades, this innovation cycle needs to halve.
6.33.	 Expanding renewable energy and clean fuels will increase demand for land and water. 
The future scenarios of an increase in energy demand to meet the higher standard of living need 
to be analysed in the context of rapidly depleting land and water resources. Most renewables 
are land-intensive and demand the highest land use requirements among the different energy 
sources. The scaling required for renewable technologies faces several major challenges, 
including the large requirement for land.55 For instance, according to a study,56 about 1 MW 
of solar photovoltaic (PV) may require around 1–1.5 hectares (ha) of land, so 60 GW of solar 
power would need about 600–900 sq. km of land area at an all-India level. The availability of 
land is a major challenge for India, which has the lowest land availability per capita amongst 
the G20 countries (Figure 4). The transition cost would be amplified with the expected increase 
in the need for land for renewable energy projects.

6.34.	 Renewable waste recycling is another challenge. Globally, solar photovoltaic (PV) waste 
is estimated to be as massive as 78 million tonnes57 by 2050.58 Solar PV panels have a lifetime 
of 25-30 years, after which the discarded material can either make its way to a landfill or be 
recycled. The route to landfills is remarkably cheaper than recycling, however, this may lead to 
leaching of harmful chemicals and heavy metals mills into the soil. PV waste recycled as scrap 
poses risks to the environment and human health due to toxic metals, for which we need a 
comprehensive policy for managing PV waste. India’s amended E-Waste (Management) Rules, 
2022,59 attempts to address concerns regarding disposal practices. However, the challenge 
imposed by scale cannot be overlooked.
6.35.	 Critical minerals are required for renewable energy and battery storage technologies. 
The source of such minerals is geographically concentrated, notably Graphite (China, 79 per 
cent), Cobalt (DRC, 70 per cent), rare earth (China, 60 per cent), and Lithium (Australia, 55 
per cent). The concentration level is even higher for processing, with China dominating across 
the board. India’s initiative to build domestic capacity should be seen in the backdrop of the 
current supply chain for RE, which is heavily skewed. Box 4 discusses how the geographical 
concentration of critical and rare earth minerals is increasing and the risks this poses. India has 
joined the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) to enable access to critical minerals to smooth 
the green transition. MSP includes 14 countries, with India being the only developing country. 
The Government has also released a list of 30 critical minerals for India. At the domestic level, 
there is a greater focus on exploration. The total number of projects on critical minerals rose 
from 59 in 2020 to 123 in 2023.
6.36.	 Further, Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL)60  undertakes the identification, acquisition, 
exploration, development, mining, and processing of strategic minerals overseas by building 
mutually beneficial G2G partnerships with mineral-rich countries such as Australia, Africa, 
and Argentina, undertaking trading opportunities and strategic acquisitions or investments in 
exploration and mining.61
Box VI.4: Geographical Concentration of Critical and Rare Earth Minerals
IEA’s Global Critical Minerals Outlook 202462 highlights a profound surge in the geographical 
concentration of critical and rare earth minerals (Figure 5). In the case of refined materials, 
the share of the top three producing nations has increased since 2020 as may be observed 
in Figure 6. Further, rare earth elements (REE) that play an important role in clean energy 
transition are among the least geographically diversified of all key energy transition minerals. 
57 This corresponds to projections by IRENA for a Global cumulative PV capacity of 4,500 GW in 2050.

Magnets made from these are used in achieving higher energy efficiency for automotive 
traction motors in EVs and wind turbine motors. According to IEA projections, these are 
likely to remain heavily geographically concentrated in the future (Figure 7). Meanwhile, 
2023 also witnessed a proliferation of trade restriction measures on the ores as well as 
technologies for processing them, which has implications for the availability and access to 
essential raw materials for solar PV, wind turbines, EVs, and other consumer goods. This 
concentration of rare earth and critical minerals in mining and processing is a significant 
constraint on the use of renewables and EV ambitions for most countries, including India.

6.37.	 Other than risks related to access to technology and raw materials, availability and 
access to affordable finance are arguably the most significant challenges to India’s development 
of a low-carbon path. There are several estimates about the financial requirements for the 
transformation of India’s energy system to align with the Net Zero announcement. They all 
point to one fact – the requirements are of the order of trillions. As per the NITI’s IESS 2047 
model, India’s total investment cost until 2047 is conservatively estimated at ~ USD 250 billion 
per year to prepare its energy systems for Net-Zero pathways.
Box VI.5: Report on Synchronizing Energy Transitions towards Possible 
Net-Zero for India: Affordable and Clean Energy for All
A study titled ‘Synchronizing energy transitions toward possible Net Zero for India: 
affordable and clean energy for all’ was conducted by the Indian Institute of Management 
Ahmedabad with the support of the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the 
Government of India and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. The report contains 
the projection of the energy mix in the backdrop of India’s Net Zero 2070 announcements 
and cleaner, affordable energy for all. The projected future energy basket for 2030, 2050, 
and 2070 across various growth and climate commitment scenarios have been presented in 
the report.
Main Conclusions of the Report
1.	 A sustainable energy transition needs the co-existence of several energy sources. 
2.	 Coal is projected to continue until the next two decades as the backbone of the Indian 
energy system. Although technologies such as Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies 
(CDRs), such as Bioenergy with CO2 Capture & Storage (BECCS), and CCUS need to be 
explored to reduce the emissions from the use of coal. However, the energy penalty65 for 
deploying BECCS/CCUS at power plants would need a closer examination.
64 Note: Graphite is based on spherical graphite for battery grade. Rare earths are magnet rare earths.
65 The energy penalty is the extent of energy required to power the CCUS technologies.

3.	 Renewable Energy (RE) and nuclear power are expected to be the predominant sources 
of energy by 2070.
4.	 Coal phase-down will be heavily dependent on the import of critical minerals required 
for renewable energy and battery storage unless the country invests in the development 
of technologies based on domestically available mineral resources and those that enable 
the reuse, recovery, and recycling of critical minerals.
Finance for Sustainable Development
6.38.	 The country has taken many measures to improve the business environment and 
catalyse greater quantum of resources. The ‘Framework for Sovereign Green Bonds’ released 
in 2022 has enabled the mobilisation of resources from diversified investors for green projects, 
deepening the bond market. The framework has been rated as ‘Medium Green’ with a ‘Good’ 
governance score by CICERO, a Norway-based Second Party Opinion provider, highlighting 
India’s credibility and readiness to issue sovereign green bonds. The Government undertook 
the issue of sovereign green bonds amounting to ₹16,000 Crore in January-February 2023 
to raise proceeds for public sector projects that would contribute to the efforts to reduce the 
intensity of the economy's emissions, followed by ₹20,000 Crore raised through sovereign 
green bonds in October-December 2023. 
6.39.	 SEBI has been one of the early adopters of sustainability reporting for listed entities 
and has required mandatory ESG-related disclosures for the top 100 listed entities (by market 
capitalisation) since 2012. Over the years, SEBI strengthened the reporting to cover the top 
500 and then the top 1000 entities. SEBI issued new sustainability reporting requirements 
under the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which are more granular 
with quantifiable metrics in line with the principles ensconced in the ‘National Guidelines on 
Responsible Business Conduct’. The BRSR was mandatory for the top 1000 listed entities (by 
market capitalisation) from 2022–23. In July 2023, the SEBI also introduced the BRSR core 
for ESG disclosures for value chains. From 2024-25, these disclosure requirements apply to the 
top 250 listed companies and will be extended to the 1000 top-listed entities in a phased manner 
by 2026-27. The value chain shall encompass a listed entity's top upstream and downstream 
partners, cumulatively comprising 75 per cent of its purchases/sales (by value), respectively. 
The BRSR Core is a sub-set of the BRSR, consisting of a set of Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs)/metrics under specific ESG attributes.66
6.40.	 RBI has implemented the Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits for the Regulated 
Entities to foster and develop a green finance ecosystem in the country. In addition, the RBI 
promotes renewable energy through its Priority Sector Lending (PSL) rules. The notified PSL 
rules by RBI facilitate concessional credit for renewable energy generation and certain mitigation 
projects. This includes, for example, bank loans up to a limit of ₹30 Crore to borrowers for 
purposes like solar-based power generators, biomass-based power generators, windmills, and 
micro-hydel plants. Non-conventional energy-based public utilities, such as street lighting 
systems and remote village electrification, are also eligible for priority sector classification per 
the notification.

PUTTING IN PLACE A MARKET FRAMEWORK TO PRICE 
CARBON: INDIAN CARBON MARKET (ICM)
6.41.	 The regulations on the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), also called the Indian 
Carbon Market, were notified by the Ministry of Power on 28 June 2023. The objective of CCTS 
is to allow the determination of a price for one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, 
encouraging an obligated entity to factor in the cost of a resource that was not priced earlier, 
thereby incentivising investment in alternative low-emission technologies. CCTS will subsume 
the existing PAT scheme, where the Designated Consumers (DCs) under the PAT scheme will 
gradually transition to CCTS by 2028-30. Under the CCTS, the Government shall set entity-wise 
GHG emission intensity targets to enable a per-output emissions limit (i.e., GHG emissions 
intensity target) in place of specific energy consumption targets under the existing PAT scheme. 
Key institutions and stakeholders that will play a crucial role in the oversight, implementation, 
and guidance of the ICM are as follows (Table 1):
Table VI.1: Institutional Architecture of Carbon Market in India

6.42.	 The CCTS envisages a compliance mechanism whereby the registered entities notified 
under the mechanism, called obligated entities (OE), will be notified of GHG emission 
intensity targets for each annual year in the trajectory period (called the compliance year). 
On completion of the trajectory period, the targets shall be revised for subsequent periods. 
The obligated entities would be required to comply and furnish the compliance status with the 
targets set after the verification and trading process within nine months from the completion of 
the compliance cycle. The entity obligated to achieve greater than the target notified can get the 
Carbon Credit Certificates (CCC) issued by the difference between the actual and target. These 
CCCs can be sold in the carbon market or banked by the obligated entity on completion of the 
compliance year. The banked CCCs can be sold or used to achieve compliance in the following 
years. An obligated entity failing to meet the targets would be required to buy the CCCs in the 
Indian carbon market or use their banked CCCs for compliance.
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM)
6.43.	 Carbon markets can be compliance markets run and regulated by governments or 
international bodies, with specific industries required to participate (compliance market), or 
could be voluntary carbon markets- which are not regulated by governments and are entirely 
voluntary. The global voluntary carbon market is worth over USD 1.2 billion, and India is the 
second-largest supplier of carbon offsets. 

Climate Change and Energy Transition
201
6.44.	 A VCM allows entities to compensate for their emissions through emission reduction/
removal/avoidance achieved in projects elsewhere or by other entities – a process termed 
‘carbon offsetting’. The purchaser of an offset credit can retire the offset to claim the underlying 
reduction towards their own emission reduction goals. However, there are concerns about 
double counting in VCM when sellers and buyers can claim the carbon reductions. There 
is also uncertainty about whether a credit being used as an offset by a foregin entity can be 
simultaneously claimed by the country where the credit was generated for their emission 
reduction target. If this is not, then with India’s ambitious NDC and Net Zero announcement, 
carbon credits sold to foreign entities will make India’s emissions reduction more expensive 
and difficult.
Box VI.6: Evolution of Carbon Markets
The existence of the first market-based regulation to abate the air pollution level and address 
environmental problems can be traced back to the sulphur dioxide (SO2) allowance trading 
programme by the United States in the 1970s. The Montreal Protocol (1987) served as an 
early international precedent for trading emissions permits to address ozone depletion. 
Article 4.2(a) of the UNFCCC (Convention) set the foundation for early carbon markets by 
allowing the Parties to implement emission reduction policies jointly. 
The Conference of the Parties or COP of the UNFCCC adopted a legal instrument in this 
regard - the Kyoto Protocol (KP) in 1997. The KP established legally binding GHG emissions 
reduction targets for 38 industrialised countries and Economies in Transition (EIT) – Annex-B 
Parties to the KP. Market-based mechanisms under the KP allowed Parties to meet part of 
their Kyoto caps with ‘Kyoto units’ bought from other Parties. It had three mechanisms – (i) 
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) leading to Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) 
from mitigation projects in developing countries,67 (ii) Joint Implementation creating 
Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) achieved by projects in countries with emission caps, 
and (iii) International Emissions Trading (IET) enabled trading of Assigned Amount Units 
(AAUs) and other Kyoto units between countries with emission caps. These mechanisms 
laid the foundation for the first-ever effort in the international carbon market, though 
its initial implementation faced challenges like limited participation and complex rules. 
However, after the launch of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) in 
2005, the significance of the carbon market was realised for the first time. It was around the 
mid-2000s that EU-ETS started functioning, and Voluntary Carbon Markets began to gain 
traction. The fungibility of the credits with EU-ETS helped the Kyoto Protocol to establish a 
stronger carbon price in its first commitment period (2008-2012).
The second commitment period (2013-2020) of the KP was adopted in December 2012, while 
the EU-ETS entered its third phase in 2013-2020. The cumulative inflow of international 
credits led to a large surplus in the European carbon market and undermined the carbon 
price incentive; for example, prices fell from €15/tCO2e in 2011 to a price range of €3 - €8/
tCO2e in the 2013 - 2015 period. The EU decided not to allow CERs and ERUs from KP to be 
compliance units within the EU-ETS and made it mandatory to exchange the Kyoto units for 
EU-ETS emission allowances. The second phase of the KP’s carbon markets failed mainly
67  Developing countries did not have obligation to cap emissions.

due to the non-participation of some major developed economies and due to the non-
interchangeability of the Kyoto credits with EU-ETS68. With the end of the KP in 2020, the 
CDM also dried up and was replaced by the unregulated buyers and sellers of the carbon 
market, the VCM.          
The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, provides countries the option to voluntarily 
cooperate for higher ambition in their NDCs through a unified global carbon market. 
a.  Article 6.2 calls for ‘voluntary cooperative approaches’ at the bilateral level involving 
the use of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs)69  in meeting 
NDCs, promoting sustainable development, and ensuring environmental integrity and 
transparency while avoiding any double counting. 
b.  Article 6.4 defines an international mechanism to issue emission credits against mitigation 
outcomes. Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement mechanism thus became the successor 
to the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM.70 If authorised by the host country, the emission credits 
(or Emission Reductions) generated by mitigation activities become ITMOs. Another 
country can use them to fulfil its NDC or for other mitigation purposes, and calls for the 
corresponding adjustment in the origin county to avoid any double counting. 
   Negotiations are still ongoing on the implementation of Articles 6.2 and 6.4.  
6.45.	 The carbon market's effectiveness in emission reduction in India will depend on its 
regulation and implementation in the context of the target of Viksit Bharat by 2047 and Net 
Zero by 2070. While the domestic compliance market developed under the CCTS is essential 
to ensure that the industry internalises the emission costs into its production and investment 
decisions, we may not subsidise the transition of other countries. 
6.46.	  The Government of India’s Mission LiFE is envisaged as a mass movement to address 
climate change and foster sustainable living based on conservation and moderation principles. 
The Government supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit 
Programme (GCP), which incentivises individuals, communities, private sector industries, 
and companies to participate in environment-positive activities by offering green credits as 
rewards. Box 7 presents a brief discussion on GCP.

introduced two pioneering programs: the Green Credit Programme (GCP) and the Ecomark 
Scheme.72
Objectives of GCP: The GCP is an innovative market-based mechanism aimed at 
encouraging individuals, communities, private sector industries, and companies to engage 
in voluntary environmental positive actions through the issuance of green credits. 
Implementation and governance: According to the Green Credit Rules, 2023, notified 
in October 2023, GCP shall be implemented through a phased and iterative approach. 
In the initial phase, it focuses on voluntary tree plantation on degraded land, wasteland, 
watershed, etc., under the control and management of the Forest departments. The 
governance structure of GCP includes the Steering Committee members from concerned 
ministries, experts, and institutions. Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education 
(ICFRE) is designated as the GCP administrator and is responsible for the implementation 
and management of GCP. GCP's digital processes include a dedicated web platform and a 
green credit registry for streamlining operations. Registration, accounting, and green credit 
issuance monitoring ensure the transparency and accountability of GCP. The generation of 
green credits under Green Credit Rules, 2023, is independent of the carbon credit under the 
Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023.
A 'Green Credits Programme' was co-hosted by India and UAE on the side-lines of COP-
28. India invited all nations to join the global green credit initiative, aimed at facilitating 
global collaboration, cooperation, and partnership through the exchange of knowledge, 
experiences, and best practices in planning, implementing, and monitoring environment-
positive actions through programs/mechanisms like Green Credit. Chapter 13, a special 
essay, makes the case for the international relevance of LiFE.
INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS ON CLIMATE FINANCE: 
THE DEVELOPMENTS
6.47.	 Lack of access to adequate and affordable financial resources remains a significant 
constraint for developing countries in implementing their climate commitments. The Standing 
Committee on Finance (a body under the UNFCCC) has estimated that resources from USD 5.8 
trillion to USD 11.5 trillion are required till 2030 to meet the targets set by developing countries 
in their NDCs and other communications. The 2023 UN Adaptation Gap Report estimated 
adaptation costs in developing countries to be 10 to 18 times greater than current international 
adaptation finance flows of USD 21.3 billion.73 The UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement mandate 
that developed countries provide financial resources on a grant or concessional basis and 
provide access to technologies to developing countries to enable their climate actions. The first 
GST outcome also underscored the current needs of developing countries and the criticality

of new and additional, grant-based, highly concessional finance and non-debt instruments in 
supporting developing countries. The finance flows to developing countries from developed 
nations have been very meagre. Currently, most of the international finance available for 
developing countries is in the form of loans rather than grants.
6.48.	 The preliminary estimates of the overall resource requirement, as stated in the country’s 
NDC, is USD 2.5 trillion for 2015-2030. The Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy 
(LT-LEDS) submitted by the country highlighted that financial resources of the order of tens 
of trillions of dollars would be required by 2050 for India’s transition towards a low-carbon 
development pathway. India’s 1st Adaptation Communication (AC) submitted to UNFCCC 
mentioned the cumulative need for expenditure for adaptation to be ₹56.68 trillion by 2030. 
However, much of the resource flow for climate action - mitigation and adaptation - is primarily 
from domestic resources. 
6.49.	 Available, accessibile and affordable financial resources are essential to meet the needs 
of developing countries. UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement mandate that developed countries 
provide the resources and take the lead in mobilising finance through various sources.  
However, much of the climate action by developing countries has been done through domestic 
resources, and the emphasis of the developed countries has mainly been on private finance 
taking the lead in financing climate action. Given the scale of financial requirements, the ability 
of private capital to meet the needs even partially remains debatable. Further, the cost of such 
capital would have implications on the macroeconomic stability of the developing countries. 
While recognising the importance of private capital, a working paper by the Centre for Social 
and Economic Progress74 identifies various challenges for developing countries in attracting it 
such as limited depth of their financial markets and vulnerable debt profiles. There is further 
evidence75 to suggest that even MDBs mobilised less than a dollar from the private sector for 
every dollar of committed finance by MDBs for climate action. As reflected in an article in 
the Financial Times- ‘There’s too much to do, and given the urgency and the need to get the 
solution right, this isn’t a task for …. favourite ESG-focused portfolio manager … The sheer 
scale of the physical infrastructure that must be revamped, demolished or replaced is almost 
beyond comprehension. Governments, …, will have to lead …. The Western nations that did 
so much of the damage will have to finance the transition in the developing world — it is 
astonishing that this idea is still debated.’76 
CoP 28 and the Global Stocktake 
6.50.	 The 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 28) to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Dubai, UAE. The primary outcome of 
COP 28 included the decision on the outcome of the first GST, which seeks to ratchet up global 
climate ambition before the end of the decade, implemented in a nationally determined manner, 
taking into account the Paris Agreement and their different national circumstances. Another

significant outcome of COP 28 is the agreement on operationalising the Loss and Damage 
Fund and its funding arrangements. In line with the mandate under the Paris Agreement to 
develop a Global Goal for Adaptation (GGA), COP 28 finalised the Emirates Framework for 
Global Climate Resilience. The decision calls for all countries to have adaptation plans by 2030. 
Parties agreed on targets for the Global Goal on Adaptation, reflecting a global consensus on 
adaptation targets and the need for finance, technology, and capacity-building support to 
achieve them.
6.51.	 Under the first GST, the Parties took decisions on different themes of climate action, viz., 
mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation, including finance, capacity building, 
technology development, and technology transfer. Under finance, the GST decision recalls that 
developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties 
in continuing their obligations concerning mitigation and adaptation under the Convention 
(UNFCCC). The decision also recognises that adaptation finance must be significantly scaled 
up to support the urgent and evolving need to accelerate adaptation and build resilience in 
developing countries. Under mitigation, the decision calls upon Parties to contribute to the 
tripling of global renewable energy capacity, accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of 
unabated coal power, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, etc. These decisions are to 
be implemented in a nationally determined manner, taking into account the different national 
circumstances, pathways, and approaches of the Parties. The decision also noted that measures 
taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not constitute arbitrary or 
unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. 
New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)
6.52.	 A New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is being negotiated under the 
UNFCCC to decide an annual goal of climate finance to be mobilised by the developed countries 
for the developing countries from 2025 onward. The mandate is to set a new quantified goal 
from the floor of USD 100 billion per year, considering the needs and priorities of developing 
countries aiming to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context 
of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. Developing countries seek a) an 
ambitious mobilisation goal that adequately addresses their needs, b) grant-based or highly 
concessional and accessible financial resources, and c) a balance between the financing of 
mitigation and adaptation actions. These aspects have also been articulated in the discussions 
under the Indian presidency of the G20 and are duly reflected in the Delhi Declaration. 
INDIA’S INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS 
CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES
6.53.	  India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and 
building resilience. Some of these are discussed as follows:
	1.	 The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was established by a joint initiative of India and France 
in 2015 to deploy solar energy solutions. It is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation 
with 119 Member and Signatory countries. The organisation aims to unlock USD one trillion 
of investments in solar by 2030 by crowding in private sector investment through guarantees, 
buildings capacities and through measures to reduce the cost of technology adoption. Its 

Economic Survey 2023-24
206
programmatic support has identified a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity in its 
member countries. ISA assists in setting up solar energy demonstration projects with a 
grant of USD 50,000 for its Members categorised as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) or 
Small Island Developing States (SIDS). As of March 2024, 19 solar energy demonstration 
projects are under implementation. ISA also works on capacity building, and as part of this 
effort, around 4,000 professionals from around the globe have been trained on various 
aspects of the solar energy industry. ISA has successfully established the Solar Technology 
and Application Resources Centres (STAR-C) in Ethiopia and Somalia.  
2.	 One World, One Sun, One Grid (OSOWOG) is an ambitious project led by India and the UK to 
interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale. The vision behind the OSOWOG is the 
mantra that 'the sun never sets', and the idea is to harness solar and other renewable energy 
sources from different parts of the world, where the sun is shining at any given moment, 
and efficiently transmit that power to areas where it is needed. The OSOWOG initiative is to 
be carried out in three phases. In the first phase, the Indian grid would be connected to the 
Middle East, South Asia, and South-East Asia grids to develop a common grid. The second 
phase would connect the functional first phase to the pool of renewable resources in Africa, 
and finally, the third phase would look at achieving true global interconnection with the aim 
of 2,600 GW of interconnection by 2050. 77 
3.	 The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) was launched by India during the 
United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019. It is a global partnership of 
National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and 
financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions that 
aims to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and 
disaster risks in support of sustainable development. CDRI aims to enhance infrastructure 
resilience through capacity building, informed policy, planning, and management, leading 
to improved quality of the environment, livelihoods, and lives of over three billion people by 
2050. The organisation released its first Biennial Report on Global Infrastructure Resilience 
in 2023. It is CDRI’s contribution towards monitoring the SDGs, the Paris Agreement, 
and the Sendai Framework targets. Other interventions include financial support for peer 
learning, capacity development opportunities and sectoral programs on power, transport, 
telecommunication, health, and urban infrastructure. Further, 11 projects were awarded 
across 13 SIDS in 2023, in partnership with USAID and Miyamoto International, under 
the Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (DRI) connect, a one-stop digital knowledge exchange, 
learning, and co-creation platform. The Infrastructure Resilience Academic Exchange (IRAX) 
Programme has been conceived as a structured engagement initiative with global academic 
institutions to offer value-added education, research opportunities, and professional 
development on DRI. As part of this, in 2023, USD 5 million was provided by USAID to 
support a partnership between US universities and Indian higher education institutions to 
offer education, research, training, and professional development opportunities on DRI. 78

4.	 The Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ (IRIS), led by India, is a flagship strategic 
initiative of CDRI and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) designed to achieve and 
deliver resilience and climate adaptation solutions to the SIDS, which are among the 
most vulnerable and exposed countries. Launched in 2021, IRIS is already supported by 
commitments of USD 35 million from Australia, India, the EU, and the UK, with a target to 
attract and deploy USD 50 million to support SIDS by 2030. 79 
	5.	 Realising the importance of partnership between the Government and industry to achieve 
the goal of Net Zero, the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) was launched by 
the governments of India and Sweden in September 2019. LeadIT brings together countries 
and companies committed to action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. At COP 28, 
India and Sweden launched the second LeadIT (LeadIT 2.0) phase for 2024-26, marking 
a joint commitment by member countries and companies to shape policy frameworks and 
international cooperation for an inclusive industry transition. This new phase will focus on 
inclusive and just industry transition, co-development & transfer of low-carbon technology, 
and financial support for industry transition in emerging economies.
CONCLUSION
6.54.	 As India aims to achieve its ambitious growth targets, it faces the dual challenge of 
meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. Given the close linkage between 
energy consumption and various social indicators, the Government has a priority to ensure 
access to sustainable and clean energy sources. Non-fossil fuel sources are critical to India’s 
ambitious NDCs and Net Zero commitment. However, phasing in of non-fossil sources has 
its challenges – intermittency related to renewables, handling of nuclear and solar panel 
waste, implications of biofuel production on food security, etc. Depending on the evolving and 
ambitious NDC targets and the objective of ensuring energy security, it is amply clear that India 
needs to target a diversified set of energy sources. Such diversification will help minimise risks 
associated with energy systems while pursuing low-emission pathways in line with national 
commitments.  The integration of renewables, alongside exploring nuclear energy and biofuels, 
presents a path towards achieving these objectives. This will also include a significant role for 
thermal power, especially coal-based power plants, in providing base-load to support large-
scale deployment of renewables.
6.55.	 In exploring the landscape for ensuring energy security, it has become evident that risks 
are not merely obstacles but also harbingers of opportunities. While uncertainties loom, they 
present avenues for innovation, adaptation, and growth for India. While phasing in renewables 
to the extent possible is imperative, in the short to medium term, the focus should also be 
on actively adopting clean coal technologies.  The Government’s initiatives for (cleaner) coal, 
such as the Coal Gasification Mission, extraction of Coal Bed Methane gases, exploring Coal to 
Hydrogen, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and Coal beneficiation through washeries, etc. 
to mitigate emissions and enhance environmental sustainability needs to be promoted. With 
the advent of ultra super-critical technologies for coal power plants, it would be possible to 
lower emissions and achieve higher efficiency.

6.56.	 India’s successful renewable energy growth story is well-established. Solar power installed 
capacity has increased drastically by over 25 times between 2014 to 2023. However, several 
risks are associated with the large-scale phasing-in of renewables, such as intermittency, grid 
integration, backup power generation, storage, etc. It is important to supplement with other 
non-fossil fuel sources such as Nuclear, Biofuels, and Hydrogen.
6.57.	 It should not be that India’s high dependency on imports mainly for petroleum for 
its energy needs, shifts to high import dependency for Solar PV panels and critical minerals 
(systemic risks), whose supply chain and geopolitics may be even trickier. India needs to target 
diversified energy sources, including renewables (Solar, Wind, Large and Small Hydro), green 
hydrogen, nuclear, and biofuels. Such diversification will help minimise risks associated with 
energy systems while pursuing low-emission pathways in line with national commitments. The 
diversification also includes a significant role for thermal power in providing the base load to 
support large-scale deployment of renewables.
6.58.	 Many technologies required for global Net Zero are commercially unavailable, such as 
hydrogen-fuelled Steel/Cement, Steel and Aluminium production with CCUS, etc. There is a 
need to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in the domains of distributed RE, 
offshore wind, geothermal, tidal energy, biofuels, Compressed Bio Gas, green hydrogen, energy 
storage, electrolysers, and nuclear power (including Small Modular Reactors SMR). 
6.59.	 Availability, affordability, and accessibility of financial resources will drive the green 
transition. While India has relied upon its resources so far, it is vital that resources from 
developed countries and mobilised by the latter flow to the developing countries in line with 
the objectives of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. The negotiations on the New Collective 
Quantified Goal must lead to outcomes required to meet the temperature goal of the Paris 
Agreement. The global narrative on the issue of climate change, describing it as a climate 
emergency, shifts focus from the equally, if not more, critical developmental problems and can 
cause panic.80,81  The world needs a more balanced approach to the issue of climate change. It 
should also focus on nearer-term policy goals of improving human welfare rather than being 
excessively preoccupied with one large, longer-term goal of global climate management.

SOCIAL SECTOR: BENEFITS 
THAT EMPOWER
India’s high and sustained economic growth in recent years is being accompanied 
by social and institutional progress, underpinned by transformational and effective 
implementation of Government programmes with an empowering edge that has 
become the hallmark of a transformed approach to welfare. Be it health, education, 
sanitation, digital empowerment, or quality of life in rural areas, each aspect of the 
social infrastructure ecosystem has made strides through effective planning and 
delivery of various welfare schemes. The outcomes and success stories of the endeavours 
being made by the Government to ensure ease of living for one and all are evident. The 
realms of health and education are witnessing turning points in quality and access. 
Women-led development is being promoted with 360-degree enabling interventions for 
socioeconomic empowerment. A slew of programmes for transparent and digitalised 
rural governance have accompanied a perceptible improvement in the standard of 
living. To attain the much-avowed status of a developed country by 2047, effective and 
efficient Government programmes and state-level initiatives, augmented by community 
participation, are key.
INTRODUCTION
7.1	
India is on the path to scaling the next level of the development ladder to a ‘Developed 
India’ step by 2047 (ViksitBharat@2047). Economic growth is a pathway to achieve the end 
goal of development comprising economic, social, technological, and institutional progress. 
However, the direction of public policy and its implementation are also instrumental in 
translating growth to across-the-board human development. Home to 18 per cent of humanity1, 
India’s social infrastructure must reach a diverse and expansive populace, transcending 
cultures, languages, and geographies. Boasting a young and aspirational society, India aims 
to seize the opportunities provided by steady and high economic growth while also ensuring 
a society characterised by better health care, education, clean water, sanitation facilities, 
affordable housing, electricity, and the internet. A vast amount of ground has been covered to 
ensure sustainable and equitable economic growth and the journey continues with challenges, 
old and new, as well as solutions, centralised and local. 
7.2	
Over the last decade, the Indian concept of welfare has been significantly transformed into 
a more long-term-oriented, efficient, and empowering avatar. This has further strengthened 
the welfare ecosystem and helped lay a solid foundation for human development in the country.

Besides, the Government’s social sector expenditure has been keeping pace with the sector’s 
growing importance. The Government’s spending on social services has shown a rising trend 
since FY16, with a focus on many aspects of the social well-being of citizens of the country, as 
evident from Table VII.1. Between FY18 and FY24, nominal GDP has grown at a compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 9.5 per cent. Overall, welfare expenditure has grown at 
a CAGR of 12.8 per cent. Expenditure on education has grown at a CAGR of 9.4 per cent- a tad 
below the rate of nominal GDP growth. Expenditure on health, as shown in the Table below, 
has grown at a CAGR of 15.8 per cent.

(ii) * The Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India, also calculates the General Government spending 
on education. While RBI’s data on Education expenditure incorporates the spending incurred by Centre and 
States on ‘Education, Sports, Arts, and culture, MoE’s estimates also include expenditure incurred on medical 
and public health education, agriculture research and education, welfare of SC, ST, OBC & Minority’s education, 
other scientific research & development, Education under social security, Nutritious food expenditure under mid-
day meal, expenditure on imparting training to police, Labour employment and skill development expenditure, 
education/training expenditure under rural development Programmes etc. This leads to a higher estimate of 
expenditure on education, which is 4.64 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 (latest available).

This chapter presents the impact of the high economic growth in recent years on the 
citizens of the country. Section I discusses some critical outcomes in the overarching area of the 
standard of living of the populace. Some key areas, such as health, and education, are covered 
in some detail. In light of the emphasis on Nari Shakti, Section II dwells on the rising women 
power in the country and the active role of Government policies and programmes in this 
regard. A large population of the country resides in rural India. The developments happening 
at the grassroots level and the role of Government policies and programmes for rural India are 
presented in Section III.

the lives of average Indians are better than a decade ago. Over 10.3 crore women have been 
provided free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, 11.7 crore toilets have been 
built under Swachh Bharat Mission, 52.6 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened, 3.47 
crore pucca houses have been built for the poor people under the PM-AWAS Yojana, 11.7 crore 
households provided tap water connections under Jal Jeevan Mission, and 6.9 crore hospital 
admissions have been made under the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. Behind these numbers lie 
numerous stories of better lives. 
7.6	
India’s social and economic milieu presents many strengths, opportunities, and challenges. 
Its strengths can be counted as the fastest-growing economy, which is making great strides 
in delivering welfare and opportunities to its people through the creation and expansion of 
digital public infrastructure (DPI). The opportunities are reflected in the fact that 18 per cent 
of the population is in the age group of 15-24 years (compared to the global average of 15.4 per 
cent), with a median age of 28.2 years.5 This young India wants to climb the ladder of social 
and financial progress faster. These strengths and opportunities are also counter-balanced 
by significant challenges, including improving learning outcomes in schools, eliminating 
malnutrition, channelising the potential of the hinterland, tackling regional, caste and gender 
disparities, and instilling accountability and transparency at all levels of the Government. In 
light of limited fiscal resources, the expectations of the socio-economically diverse populace 
necessitate a sensitive, pragmatic, and prudent welfare policy.
7.7	
This required transforming the approach to a long-term-oriented, efficient, and 
empowering one, recognising universal access to basic amenities as a starter for inclusive 
growth, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives. In contrast to short-term measures 
requiring repeated disbursement of scarce resources, such an approach not only builds social 
infrastructure for the decades to come but also enables individuals to climb up the standard-
of-living ladder and utilise the opportunities accompanying high growth. Socially empowering 
the citizens inculcates a sense of autonomy and self-confidence by altering social relationships, 
institutions, and discourses so that the hitherto excluded disadvantaged sections of society can 
also find a place in the sun. Placing people on the 'development' treadmill from the 'welfare' 
treadmill is not just a matter of fiscal sustainability. Self-esteem and personal dignity also 
stand enhanced when members of the public participate in and contribute to development, 
moving away from welfare dependence. As Rama Bijapurkar notes, even among the socially 
disadvantaged, “there is a distinct and growing segment who, with some combination of access 
to networks, information, Government support, and personal circumstances, find the agency 
and energy to try and strive for opportunities for a better life.”6
Pillars of the new approach to welfare
7.8	
The new welfare approach bears in mind that spending alone cannot guarantee outcomes. 
It lays a strong focus on transforming the implementation and effectiveness of Government 
programmes, thus increasing the impact per rupee spent. Cost-effectiveness is increasingly

being pointed out in academic literature, too. For instance, Muralidharan (2024)7 estimates that 
unless the efficiency of converting spending into outcomes is substantially improved, neither 
a growth focus nor a development focus (i.e., increasing budget allocation to social sectors) 
will lead to satisfactory outcomes in tackling child stunting, improving learning in schools, 
reducing the infant mortality rate. To this end, the Government is emphasising process reforms 
and accountability, interwoven with the utilisation of technology. 
7.9	
The digitisation of healthcare, education and governance has been a force multiplier for 
every rupee spent on a welfare programme. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and 
Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and 
minimisation of leakages, with more than ₹38 lakh crore having been transferred via DBT since 
its inception in 2013.8 
7.10	 The Government has also implemented a goal-oriented approach for budgetary allocation, 
comprising expected outputs and outcomes of the schemes, as part of the Outcome Budget, 
which has been accompanying the conventional annual Budget since FY 18. An ‘Output-Outcome 
Monitoring Framework’ has been developed by NITI Aayog for the major central sector and 
centrally sponsored schemes since FY 20. Moreover, acceleration in capital expenditure within 
social services expenditure signifies higher productivity and creation of societal assets. This is 
set against the backdrop of ubiquitous, user-friendly dashboards and management information 
systems (MIS) across major schemes, instilling transparency and accountability through real-
time monitoring. Box VII.1 delves deeper into the rising heft of data in governance.
Box VII.1: Transforming data governance in India: DGQI 2.0 and beyond
Over the past few decades, the Government of India has made significant strides in managing 
and utilising data effectively. Recent decades have witnessed a digital transformation, 
with MIS and centralised data access through policies like the National Data Sharing & 
Accessibility Policy and data.gov.in. Dashboard systems and platforms like District 
Development Coordination and Monitoring Committees (DISHA), Prayas, and Output 
Outcome Monitoring Framework have improved accountability in public policy. 
Today, most Government programmes utilise internal MIS that capture vast amounts of 
data. In today’s digital age, effectively managing this data, extracting actionable insights 
for decision-making, facilitating course corrections, and ensuring interoperability across 
Government data units are critical objectives of India’s data strategy towards a Viksit Bharat. 
It would bolster data availability for decision-making and foster system interoperability for 
a seamless experience for beneficiaries accessing Government services. 
In this context, a comprehensive review of present data preparedness levels of all Ministries/
Departments (M/D) was required to chart the way forward and suggest measures for 
improvement. Against this background, the Data Governance Quality Index (DGQI) exercise 
was initiated to assess the data preparedness of various M/D on a standardised framework 
to drive healthy competition among them and promote cooperative peer learning from best 
practices.

The exercise is conducted periodically, where the Ministries are requested to fill out 
responses to a standard questionnaire on the DGQI dashboard. The exercise culminates in 
a report that includes rankings of all M/Ds and their schemes, providing analytical insights 
for further improvement and learning. The index has progressed from an average score9 
of 2.29/5 in the 1st Round in 2020 to 3.95/5 in the latest Round, i.e., Round 6 in 2024, 
comprising around 75 M/Ds and 567 interventions/schemes. 
It is hoped that in the long run, DGQI will help in laying the foundation of robust data 
monitoring system of all the CS/ CSS schemes of all M/Ds, ultimately leading to a state-of-
the-art data-driven decision making.
7.11	 The approach also comprises targeted implementation reforms for last-mile service 
delivery to truly realise the maxim of “no person left behind.” The Aspirational Districts 
Programme (ADP), following the 3C approach of ‘Convergence’ across levels of Government, 
‘Collaboration’ between civil society and Government, and ‘Competition’ among states and 
districts through a dashboard monitoring monthly progress led to substantial improvement 
in several indicators such as health and nutrition, education, and reporting saturation in 
the basic infrastructure such as electricity connections, all-weather roads, basic sanitation 
facilities, etc. An appraisal of the programme by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) concluded that the programme has resulted in sectoral growth and improvements 
in governance and administration.10Box VII.2 presents two success stories of the ADP. Other 
targeted programmes include the Aspirational Blocks Programme, launched in 2023, the 
Vibrant Villages Programme for border areas, and more recently, the Viksit Bharat Sankalp 
Yatra, which saw participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 2023, 
are other examples of going the extra mile for saturation of various Government schemes.

Box VII.2: Baramulla and Gumla progress from ‘Aspiration’ to 
‘Transformation’
Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir and Gumla, Jharkhand, won the prestigious PM Awards 
for excellence in Public Administration 2022 under the ADP category. The initiatives in 
Gumla and Baramulla showcase the transformative impact of targeted interventions under 
the ADP, significantly improving health and education outcomes. 
Baramulla addressed its challenging topography and harsh weather by establishing birth 
waiting wards in Uri and Boniyar, benefiting 20,000 pregnant women. Severe acute 
malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition rates declined to near-zero levels through 
monitoring with Poshan tracker tabs. Educational initiatives included 18 lab schools 
focusing on innovative teaching techniques and improving learning outcomes. Hybrid 
learning and ICT tools prepared students for competitive exams. Other efforts included 
crop diversification, mushroom cultivation, organic farming, and dairy units. Governance 
measures involved digital gap analysis, biometric attendance, and an Innovation Cell for 
academics.
Gumla tackled anaemia and malnutrition by promoting the cultivation of Ragi, empowering 
women in Self-Help Groups (SHGs) through livelihood opportunities. This initiative 
addressed the district’s challenges of low income, poor productivity, and lack of critical 
infrastructure. Tribal women handled Ragi’s procurement, processing, packaging, and 
marketing. Governance initiatives included an open-door policy for public grievances, regular 
meetings, and optimal fund allocation. The innovative Ragi Mission broke the stagnant 
monocropping practice by expanding the ragi cultivated area by 3500 acres, resulting in 
a 219 per cent increase in production in FY22. Solar-based lift and drip irrigation systems 
covering more than 4349 acres ensure all-year round agricultural practice in the region.
7.12	 This transformed approach to welfare further encompassed prioritising social enablers. 
Accordingly, stress was placed on investments in health and sanitation. For example, child 
immunisation under Mission Indradhanush and sanitation through programmes like ODF 
and ODF plus and Swachh Bharat Mission have led to lesser disease incidence due to cleaner 
practices, lesser school absenteeism due to illness, and more effective nutrient absorption over 
the long run among the least privileged. According to the fifth National Family Health Survey 
(NFHS-5), the percentage of children aged 12-23 months who are fully vaccinated increased 
from 77.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 83.8 per cent during 2019-21.
7.13	 Another policy of the Government, given the country’s demography and occupation 
profile, has been to provide affordable social security schemes for the unorganised sector 
workers. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY), PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJY), and PM Suraksha 
Bima Yojana (PMSBY) (all three launched in 2015) are success stories of an expanding social 
safety net equipped with universal bank account penetration. While PM-JJY and PM-SBY were 
the first of their kind, the APY improved remarkably upon its predecessor, the Swavalamban 
Yojana. 

Economic Survey 2023-24

7.14	 The approach to welfare is wholesome and whole-of-society, with increasing private sector 
participation through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In 2014, spending by companies 
on social purpose programmes was made mandatory through a new provision under Section 
135 of the Companies Act 2013.11 The trend of CSR spending post-2014 is presented in Box VII.3. 
With the robust growth of the economy, corporate profits in India and, hence, the mandatory 
CSR pool will continue to grow, powering the sustainable and inclusive development that non-
profits are uniquely positioned to accelerate with their last-mile presence on the ground.
Box VII.3: Corporate Social Responsibility – Building bridges between profit 
and purpose
Some trends in the extent of CSR activities as per the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)’s 
data are presented below.
(a)  In the eight years from 2014 to 2022, ₹1.53 lakh crore were spent on CSR, and the 
spending across the last three years constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total CSR 
amount spent since 2014. CSR compliance has seen a growing adherence over the years, 
with more than half the companies even going beyond their obligation. For the last three 
years, yearly CSR spending has been more than ₹25 thousand crore, with yearly CSR 
spending increasing by 1.5 times in eight years.12

(b)  Public sector units, while constituting about 2 per cent of the companies under CSR 
mandate, contribute to almost 17 per cent of the total CSR amount.
(c)  Sector-wise, more than three-fourths of total CSR spend is in the top four development 
sectors, i.e., Education (32.4 per cent), Healthcare & Sanitation (38.4 per cent), Rural 
Development (6.9 per cent), and Environment, Animal Welfare & Conservation (10.9 
per cent).
(d)  About half of the implementation of CSR funds happens in partnership with non-
profit organisations. This implementation model adopted by companies has provided 
an excellent boost to the non-profit ecosystem in the country besides enabling cross-
pollination of ideas across sectors. While non-profits learn analytical and process-based 
rigour from partner companies, the latter have benefitted from community engagement 
and inclusive outlook as the corporate citizens of the society.
(e)  The distribution of CSR investment is primarily centred around the hubs of corporate 
headquarters in the country, while underdeveloped areas remain relatively less funded. 
For regionally-balanced CSR spending, there is a need for enhanced investment in the 
organisational growth and capacity building of the non-profit organisations working in 
underdeveloped areas.

Overall Progress and Outcomes 
Improvements in multidimensional poverty 
7.15	 Focusing solely on income is not enough to capture the actual reality of poverty, as it 
may conceal the exact deprivations experienced by millions of individuals every day. Here, the 
measurement of multidimensional poverty is valuable to gauge the incidence and intensity of 
poverty as it is lived by revealing who is poor and the different disadvantages they experience.
7.16	 The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been estimated for India by NITI 
Aayog, which is in line with the global MPI13 published by the UNDP, with a few customisations 
for the Indian context.14 The MPI estimated by the Niti Ayog has three equally weighted 
dimensions: health, education, and standard of living, split across 12 weighted indicators. These 
deprivations are very basic and, hence, emblematic of real poverty, in addition to informing 
policymakers of the necessities lacking in the country.15 
7.17	 While the headcount ratio measures the spread of multidimensional poverty, the 
deprivation score measures the intensity of multidimensional poverty (i.e., the number of 
deprivations experienced by a poor person). A weighted deprivation score of 0.33 is required 
for a household to qualify as MPI-poor. The MPI index is thus obtained as the product of 
headcount ratio (HCR) and intensity. 
India’s Progress in MPI: 2019-21 vs. 2015-16
7.18	 There has been a sharp decline in the HCR accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of 
poverty, with the MPI nearly halving from 0.117 in 2015-16 to 0.066 in 2019-21, thereby setting 
India on the path of achieving the SDG Target 1.2 (of reducing multidimensional poverty by 
at least half) much ahead of the stipulated timeline of 2030. Resultantly, 13.5 crore Indians 
are estimated to have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21. This 
decline is driven by declining deprivations in nutrition, years of schooling, sanitation, and 
cooking fuel, attributable to large-scale policy attention. Region-wise, this trend is driven by 
rural India, with the most significant improvements occurring in states like Bihar, MP, UP, 
Odisha, and Rajasthan. Uttar Pradesh registered the most significant decline in the number of 
poor people, with 3.43 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty. Notably, the number 
of States with less than 10 per cent of people living in multidimensional poverty doubled from 
7 in 2016 to 14 in 2021.

15  The Alkire-Foster methodology has been adopted to develop this index. It has many axiomatic advantages 
such as monotonicity, scale and replication invariance, symmetry, poverty, and deprivation focus, etc., making 
it a globally accepted methodology. This is largely same as Global MPI by UNDP & OPHI, with 2 additional 
indicators, i.e., maternal health and bank account, using the data from the NFHS.

7.19	 NITI Aayog’s discussion paper, ‘Multidimensional Poverty in India since 2005-06’,16 
finds that 24.82 crore people have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2013-14 and 
2022-23. To assess the poverty levels in 2013-14 and 2022-23, projected estimates based 
on the compounded annual rate of change have been used due to data limitations for these 
specific periods. According to the NITI’s paper, India has registered a significant decline in the 
proportion of individuals in multidimensional poverty in India from 29.17 per cent in 2013-14 
to 11.28 per cent in 2022-23, i.e. a reduction of 17.89 percentage points.
7.20	 The paper also highlights that UP registered the largest decline in the number of poor, 
with 5.94 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty during the last nine years, followed 
by Bihar at 3.77 crore, MP at 2.30 crore and Rajasthan at 1.87 crore. Overall, the decline in 
poverty HCR was much faster between 2015-16 and 2019-21 (10.66 per cent annual rate of 
decrease) than from 2005-06 to 2015-16 (7.69 per cent annual rate of decline). 
Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2022-23
7.21	 The results of various initiatives in the social sector have translated into reduced 
inequality and rising consumption spending, as evident from the results of the latest Household 
Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23 (conducted from August 2022 to July 
2023), released on 24 February 2024.17 The results provide insights into the monetary aspect of 
living standards across rural and urban areas, estimated as the monthly per capita consumption 
expenditure (MPCE). The results broadly confirm the substantial rise in non-income aspects of 
living standards noted previously in the multidimensional poverty report of the NITI Aayog.
7.22	 The HCES offers many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. The 
MPCE in 2022-23 increased in real terms by 40 per cent in rural and 33.5 per cent in urban 
areas over 2011-12. The Gini coefficient, an indicator of inequality, has declined from 0.283 
to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country. The 
rural-urban divide has also declined considerably, as the difference between rural and urban 
MPCE declined from 83.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 71.2 per cent in 2022-23. Within rural and 
urban areas, the consumption of the lowest 5 per cent of the MPCE population grew faster than 
the top 5 per cent, indicating a decline in economic inequality over the last decade. Imputation 
of free-of-cost items provided through various Government programmes leads to a further 
progressive rise in MPCE, with the benefit of welfare schemes as a proportion of MPCE at 
0.8 per cent for the top 5 per cent fractile and 5.0 per cent for the bottom 5 per cent fractile 
in rural areas (for urban areas, the corresponding figures were 0.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent 
respectively). Juxtaposing the MPCE numbers with the per capita gross national income (PCI) 
reveals an inclusive trend in economic growth, where the MPCE/PCI ratio has increased for all 
consumption classes except the top 5 per cent in rural India and the top 10 per cent in urban 
India. Notably, this progress occurred despite the once-in-a-century crisis of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Quality Healthcare for All
7.23	 For a resilient economy, the health sector is vital. A sound healthcare system is 
interconnected with long-term factors responsible for inclusive growth, such as ensuring the 
quality of human capital and labour productivity, higher household savings, avoiding the 
poverty trap due to catastrophic health expenditure, and building the capability to withstand any 
health shocks such as COVID-19. In that spirit, the Indian health system has been consistently 
revamped.
7.24	 The Government is committed to ensuring sound health and well-being of all ages through 
a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmental policies and universal 
access to good quality healthcare services. To this end, the Government is implementing various 
schemes and programmes. Key initiatives and their progress are listed in Table VII.2.

Minding the Mind: Taking stock of the mental health scenario
7.25	 Mental health is a less seen yet principally impactful driver of individual and national 
development. Way back in 1954, Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of the World 
Health Organization (WHO), famously said, “Without mental health, there can be no true 
physical health.”
7.26	 Mental well-being is intertwined with all aspects of health, viz. physical, social, and 
emotional, and can be described as a state of well-being in which a person is able to cope with 
the stresses of daily life, continue to be productive and contribute to the community. Mental 
health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities, as well as mental 
states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm. From 
minor stressors to severe disorders, mental health concerns can have an impact throughout an 
individual’s lifetime.
Rising prevalence of mental health issues
7.27	 As per WHO, in 201922, one in every eight people, or 970 million people globally, were 
living with a mental disorder23, with anxiety and depression being the most common conditions. 
The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 27.6 per cent increase in cases of major depressive disorders 
and a 25.6 per cent increase in cases of anxiety disorders in 2020 globally.24 According to a 
large-scale study co-led by researchers from Harvard Medical School and the University of 
Queensland, one out of every two people in the world will develop a mental health disorder in 
their lifetime (McGrath et al., 2023).25
7.28	 In the Indian context, the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-1626 showed that 
10.6 per cent adults suffered from mental disorders in India while treatment gap for mental 
disorders ranged between 70 to 92 per cent for different disorders. Further, as per the survey, the 
prevalence of mental morbidity was higher in urban metro regions (13.5 per cent) as compared

to rural areas (6.9 per cent) and urban non-metro areas (4.3 per cent). The second and more 
expansive NMHS is currently in progress. According to Dhyani et al. (2022), individuals aged 
25-44 years are the most affected by mental illnesses.27 
Evolving Mental Health of Children and Youth
7.29	 Sound mental health of children and adolescents is the foundation of their holistic 
development and a critical step towards ensuring quality economic growth. This assumes 
urgency in the wake of rising prevalence of mental health issues in youth, attributable to 
academic pressures, social media, family dynamics, and socio-economic environment. Globally, 
one in seven 10-19-year-olds experience a mental disorder (WHO 2021).28 According to research 
carried out by Gallup for UNICEF’s Changing Childhood report, a median of 19 per cent of 15 to 
24-year-olds in 21 countries self-reported in the first half of 2021 that they often feel depressed 
or have little interest in doing things.29 
7.30	 In India, NCERT’s Mental Health and Well-being of School Students Survey30 showed an 
increasing prevalence of poor mental health among adolescents, exacerbated by the COVID-19 
pandemic, with 11 per cent of students reported as feeling anxious, 14 per cent as feeling extreme 
emotion and 43 per cent experienced mood swings. 50 per cent of students cited studies as a 
reason for anxiety, and 31 per cent cited examination and results. 
7.31	 The increase in mental health issues in children and adolescents is often linked to the 
overuse of the internet and, specifically, social media. Unrestrained and unsupervised use of the 
internet by children can culminate into a range of problems, from the more prevalent obsessive 
consumption of social media or “doom scrolling” 31 to severe ones such as cyberbullying.32 
Jonathan Haidt, a famous American social psychologist and author, explores the impact of 
increased screen time and reduced free play on mental health issues among young people in his 
book ‘The Anxious Generation: How the great rewiring of children is causing an epidemic of 
mental illness’. Discussing the impact of social media, overprotective parenting, and the decline 
of unsupervised outdoor play on children’s emotional well-being, the book suggests that the 
epidemic of mental health issues hit the world in the early 2010s with the advent of mobile 
phones. This ‘great rewiring of childhood’ has interfered with children’s social and neurological 
development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, 
loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism.

7.32	 Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, talks about social media being akin to tobacco 
and suggests warning labels on the tech platforms, arguing that they are fuelling a mental 
health crisis among teenagers. He goes on to make a case for laws to shield the young from 
online harassment, abuse, and exploitation.33 Recently, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
Board of Education voted to prohibit smartphones for its 429,000 students in a bid to shield 
them from distractions, social media, and detrimental effects on learning and mental health.34 
In the Indian context, the rising usage of the Internet on mental health has been indicated by 
a 2021 study on ‘Effects of using Mobile Phones and other devices with Internet accessibility 
by children’ by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, according to which 
23.8 per cent of children use smartphones while they are in bed, and 37.2 per cent of children 
experience reduced levels of concentration due to smartphone use.35 
Mental Health Issues through the lens of Economics
7.33	 Mental health problems affect the quality of life of an individual and constrain the 
realisation of an individual’s potential. At an aggregate economic level, mental health disorders 
are associated with significant productivity losses due to absenteeism, decreased productivity, 
disability, increased healthcare costs, etc.36 Apart from mental health impacting economic 
development, there is also evidence of poverty affecting the risk of mental health via stressful 
living conditions, financial instability, and a lack of opportunities for upward mobility, which 
contribute to heightened psychological distress.37 Moreover, rising urbanisation and migration 
can disrupt social cohesion, traditional support systems, and stability, causing significant 
mental stress (Trivedi, Sareen, and Dhyani 2008).38
7.34	 Given the impact of mental health on growth, the returns on investment in the former 
are also high. According to a 2016 study across 36 countries, the benefit-to-cost ratio of 
substantially scaled-up treatment of depression and anxiety in 2016-30 was estimated as 2.3-
3.0 to 1 considering economic benefits only, and 3.3-5.7 to 1 when the value of health returns 
is also included (Chisholm et al. 2016).39 In the Indian context, Math et al. (2019) estimate 
the return on investment in the implementation of the Mental Health Care Act 2017 by the 
Government to be 6.5 times.40
Positive policy momentum provides tailwinds for action
7.35	 India is creating positive momentum in policy development by recognising mental health 
as a fundamental aspect of overall well-being. The Government is implementing national 
policies such as the National Mental Health Policy (2014), the National Youth Policy (2014) and 
the National Education Policy (2020), emphasising the importance of mental health across the

7.36	 In addition to national initiatives, states are implementing unique, independent initiatives 
at the state level. For instance, the State Mental Health Policy of Meghalaya outlines plans 
to train the Community Health Centre (CHC) and school staff to provide targeted support to 
children and adolescents. The Government of the NCT of Delhi has introduced a Happiness 
Curriculum for students from Nursery to Grade 8, integrating mindfulness, meditation, and 
values-based education into the school curriculum. Similarly, the ‘Our Responsibility to 
Children’ initiative launched in Kozhikode, Kerala, includes teacher, peer, and social mentoring, 
life skills education, and professional care and support for children with special needs within 
schools. These state-level initiatives complement national efforts in addressing mental health 
and well-being among children and adolescents.

Policy Recommendations on Mental Health
7.37	 While most of the policy design is in place, proper implementation can accelerate the 
improvement on the ground. That said, there remain certain gaps in the existing programmes 
which need to be addressed to maximise their effectiveness. For instance, redoubling efforts to 
increase the number of psychiatrists, from 0.75 psychiatrists per lakh population in 202143 to 
the WHO norm of 3 per lakh population (Garg, Kumar and Chandra 2019).44
7.38	 Developing comprehensive guidelines for the excellence centres’ services alongside 
mental healthcare professionals and users would help understand their needs. Also, assessing 
the effectiveness of the programmes by gathering feedback from the users, professionals, and 
stakeholders will help make necessary changes and meet the needs of a wider population. 
Nurturing peer support networks, self-help groups, and community-based rehabilitation 
programmes can help destigmatisation of mental disorders and develop a sense of belonging. 
Partnering with NGOs to scale up efforts, share knowledge, and leverage resources to enhance 
future policies will also aid in identifying areas of improvement. Involving individuals with 
personal experience with mental health problems in decision-making, service planning, 
and advocacy efforts can increase the person-centricity and recovery orientation of mental 
healthcare services (Megharajani et al. 2023).45 Sensitisation of mental health at the preschool, 
Anganwadi level can provide precious early identification of disorders. The rise in mental 
health start-ups signals a positive response from the private sector to address the care gap but 
also calls for standardisation of guidelines for such services.
7.39	 Effective pathways for integrating mental health interventions in schools can include 
developing an age-appropriate mental health curriculum for teachers and students, encouraging 
early intervention and positive language in schools, promoting community-level interactions, 
and balancing the role of technology. 
7.40	 However, the fundamental issue of the lack of awareness about mental health and the 
stigma surrounding it can render any sincerely crafted programme unfeasible. Hence, there is 
a need to bring about a paradigm shift and utilise a bottom-up, whole-of-community approach 
in addressing the topic of mental health. Breaking the stigma starts with taking cognisance of 
the natural human tendency to accept physical ailments and seeking treatment for the same 
while being in denial about mental health issues. To an extent, the denial is an outcome of fear 
about social attitudes and social acceptance after one ‘comes out’ with mental health issues.

Nonetheless, at an individual level too, there is a reluctance to see it as normal and address it. 
For public health officials, tackling mental health requires acknowledging and addressing this 
fundamental reluctance. Arguably, mental health issues drag down productivity more widely 
in the ecosystem than individuals’ physical health issues. Hence, paying attention to mental 
health issues in society is both a health and an economic imperative.
Impact manifest in health statistics
National Health Accounts show rising role of public healthcare
7.41	 Over the past few years, healthcare has become more affordable and accessible for the 
general public, as noted by the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates.46 The latest NHA 
(for FY20) show an increase in the share of Government Health Expenditure (GHE) in the total 
GDP as well as the share of GHE in Total Health Expenditure (THE). 
7.42	 Over the years, health expenditure has tilted towards primary healthcare as a building 
block of the overall health ecosystem. Research has established the importance of primary 
health care as critical to improving health outcomes, preventing several primary and secondary 
disease conditions, and reducing morbidity and mortality at much lower costs, thus significantly 
reducing the need for secondary and tertiary care.47 Consequently, the share of primary 
healthcare expenditure has increased from 51.3 per cent of GHE in FY15 to 55.9 per cent of 
GHE in FY20. The share of primary and secondary care in the GHE rose from 73.2 per cent in 
FY15 to 85.5 per cent in FY20. On the other hand, the share of primary and secondary care in 
private health expenditure has declined from 83.0 per cent to 73.7 per cent during the same 
period, attributable to rising tertiary disease burden and utilisation of Government facilities for 
primary healthcare. 
7.43	 The social security expenditure on health, which includes the social health insurance 
programme, Government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements 
made to Government employees, has increased significantly from 5.7 per cent in FY15 to 9.3 per 
cent in FY20. The rising GHE and health-related social security expenditure go hand in hand 
with a decline in out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) as a percentage of THE between FY15 and 
FY20 (Chart VII.5(a)).

7.44	 The above developments have been accompanied by improvements in key health 
indicators such as infant mortality rate (declining from 39 per 1000 live births in 2013 to 28 per 
1000 live births in 2020) and maternal mortality rate (declining from 167 per lakh live births in 
2014 to 97 per lakh live births in 2020).
7.45	 As an example of lower healthcare cost burden on families, the impact of Ayushman Bharat 
deserves mention. According to the Health Ministry’s estimates, the total cost of the treatment 

Social Sector
231
would have been 1.5 - 2 times higher if the beneficiary had availed the same treatment on their 
own outside the ambit of AB PM-JAY. Upon incorporating this multiplier effect of low costs, the 
scheme corresponds to saving more than 1.25 lakh crore of OOPE for poor and deprived families 
(as of 12 January 2024).48 Hence, besides shielding the populace from market vulnerabilities, 
Ayushman Bharat also protects the healthcare delivery system from micro-economic shocks. 
7.46	 Besides the direct impact on health indicators and OOPE, there exist various second-
order effects of health programmes. For instance, the Ayushman Bharat has been associated 
with better credit market outcomes, as detailed in Box VII.4.
Box VII.4: Health insurance programmes and impact on credit market 
outcomes
Catastrophic, unforeseen health expenses can result in the impoverishment of individuals 
and families. It can force resource-poor individuals/households to forego treatment or resort 
to debt to undertake the treatment. Mitigating healthcare costs is anticipated to improve 
financial stability and loan repayment capacity.
A recent paper49 investigates the influence of PMJAY, the world’s largest publicly funded 
health insurance scheme, on credit market dynamics in India. Comparing border regions of 
states that did not implement the program with contiguous areas belonging to states that 
implemented the program within a difference-in-difference framework, it hypothesises that 
PMJAY’s extensive coverage would lead to decreased financial strain due to healthcare costs, 
thus influencing credit behaviours like loan delinquency rates. The study employs a robust 
empirical strategy to isolate the effect of PMJAY from other factors. It utilises administrative 
data from a significant Indian credit bureau covering microfinance loan performance. The 
sample includes data on nearly 12 million loans across 636 districts in India. 
Main findings of the study
Impact on loan performance: PMJAY implementation has been found to correlate with a 
significant reduction in NPA rates in microfinance loans. The study notes that the NPA rate 
in PMJAY-implemented districts decreased by 3.7 to 4.0 percentage points compared to 
non-implemented regions. This represents a 34.6 per cent to 34.1 per cent reduction relative 
to the average NPA rates, an economically significant impact.
Impact on small agricultural loans: A similar reduction in NPA rates was observed in 
eligible small agricultural loans, underscoring PMJAY’s broad economic impact.
Implications for policy and financial markets
Public health programmes and economic stability: The study illuminates the broader 
economic impacts of public health insurance programmes. For emerging economies, where 
large segments of the population might lack access to health insurance, programmes like 
PMJAY can play a crucial role in enhancing economic stability.

Healthcare policy and household finance: These findings are particularly relevant for 
countries considering similar health insurance schemes, highlighting the potential for such 
programmes to influence household financial behaviour positively.
Conclusion
PMJAY’s implementation has markedly improved credit market outcomes in India, 
highlighting the interplay between health insurance and financial stability. This underscores 
the potential of public health initiatives to create significant economic benefits beyond 
healthcare.
7.47	 Looking forward, two trends would be decisive for the health and disease profile of the 
country in the near future. Firstly, the Government and the public at large need to accord 
healthy eating and mental health the attention they deserve. For instance, as per NFHS data, 
24.0 per cent of women and 22.9 per cent of men were overweight/obese in 2019-21, vis-à-vis 
20.6 per cent and 18.9 per cent in 2015-16, respectively. In 50 years, the incidence of type-II 
diabetes has increased from less than 2 per cent in the 1970s to more than 20 per cent.50 In 
cognisance of the rising obesity in India, public awareness of healthy eating is being promoted 
with dietary guidelines issued by the National Institute of Nutrition and the Indian Council of 
Medical Research. Secondly, public health being a state subject, state and local level governance 
remain pivotal for the national big-ticket programmes to reach the last mile through the ‘path 
of least resistance’. 
Education
7.48	 ‘Quality Education’, enlisted as Goal 4 under UN SDGs (SDG4), aims to “Ensure inclusive 
and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. 
The National Education Policy (NEP), launched in 2020 and presently in its fourth year of 
implementation, is a policy document that not only encompasses the SDG Goals on Education 
but also prepares the youth of India to take on the challenges and opportunities emerging from 
a knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century.
School education
7.49	 The school education system in India, with public and private schools, caters to around 
26 crore students from various socio-economic backgrounds. The NEP 2020 seeks to provide 
all learners in the age group of 3-18 years with access to high-quality education to create an 
educational system that is rooted in Indian culture and has the potential to establish India as a 
global knowledge superpower. 
7.50	 The NEP seeks to revamp the universe of school education to generate better learning 
outcomes for all. The gravity of the emphasis on learning can be felt in the various reports 
highlighting the gap between class standard and learning level, which has widened since 
COVID. For instance, in comparison to the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, student

performance underwent a significant drop in NAS 2021.51 Class 10 scores decreased by 13.4 per 
cent in Mathematics, 18.6 per cent in Science, and 9.1 per cent in Social Science, while Class 3 
scores decreased by 3.9 per cent in Language, 4.7 per cent in Mathematics, and 4. 4 per cent in 
Environmental Studies. 
7.51	 Implementing Early Childhood Care and Education or ECCE (refer to Box VII.5 for a 
notable initiative in ECCE), strengthening foundational literacy and numeracy, experiential 
learning, multilingual education, focusing on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary 
approaches, holistic assessment, etc., are the major recommendations of the NEP 2020 to 
develop a new system that is in line with the inspirational goals of the 21st century. 
BOX VII.5: ‘Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi’: Pre-schools network anchored in 
Anganwadis
In alignment with the guidelines of the NEP 2020, ‘Poshan bhi Padhai bhi’ (PBPB) was 
launched in May 2023. It is a path-breaking ECCE programme to help India develop the 
world’s largest, universal, high-quality preschool network at Anganwadi Centres. For the 
first time, early stimulation for 0-3 years is being covered by a Government programme.
About PBPB
Through the programme, every child would be provided with at least two hours of high-
quality preschool instruction daily. All States will follow the national ECCE task force 
recommendations for a play-based, activity-based learning pedagogy explicitly targeted at 
developmental milestones of 0-3-year-olds and 3-6-year-olds, including special support for 
Divyang children. 
Key features of PBPB 
• 
Use of teaching-learning material, including visual aids (blackboard, posters, flashcards, 
activity books, etc), audio aids (radio) and audio-visual (videos, films), spatial material 
(drawing, painting, puzzles), etc. 
• 
Mother tongue as primary teacher instruction medium
• 
Jan Andolan will involve communities in strengthening the foundations of the country’s 
future generations.
Strengthening the country-wide-web of Anganwadis
Close to 13.9 lakh operational Anganwadi centres across the country provide supplementary 
nutrition, early care and education to around eight crore beneficiary children under the age 
of 6 years, making it the largest public provisioning of such services globally. Considering 
global evidence that 85 per cent of brain development is achieved by the age of 6 years, the 
Anganwadi eco-system becomes a critical access point for building our children’s base to 
secure their future.
51  NAS is a central Government-led large-scale assessment that provides a ‘snapshot of what students know and 
can do’ at the end of Grades 3, 5, 8 and 10. About 34 lakh students of 1.18 lakh schools in 720 districts from both 
rural and urban areas participated in NAS 2021. The national, state, and district Report Cards are available at 
nas.gov.in.

Economic Survey 2023-24
234
In order to realise PBPB through Anganwadis, the latter will have to be strengthened with 
high-quality infrastructure, play equipment, and well-trained Anganwadi workers/teachers. 
In this regard, all Anganwadi Workers are to be trained on ECCE principles, including using 
activities, play and indigenous and DIY toys, through 40,000 Master Trainers. As of January 
2024, 3735 State Level Master Trainers have been trained through 95 training programmes, 
covering 25 States and 182 Districts.
The potential of Anganwadis as a useful employment generation institution and for creating 
a stronger and productive India of the future may be enhanced.

7.53	 Besides the abovementioned initiatives to ingrain NEP 2020 in school education, 
an innovative programme for community, private sector, and alumnae participation 
in strengthening Government and Government-aided schools is delved deeper into in  
Box VII.6.
Box VII.6: Vidyanjali: A school volunteer programme
The Vidyanjali programme was launched on 7 September 2021 to strengthen school 
infrastructure and improve the quality of school education through community participation, 
CSR and private sector involvement across the country as envisioned in the NEP 2020. 
The programme offers companies/organisations/trusts, and groups an opportunity to 
support multiple schools of their choice by participating in projects created by States/
UTs and autonomous bodies through a dedicated CSR module on the portal. This is not to 
substitute the Government’s responsibility but to complement, supplement and strengthen 
Government efforts to reach the last mile in the best possible way.
Vidyanjali portal (https://vidyanjali.education.gov.in) acts as a facilitator by connecting 
volunteers - alumni of educational institutions, serving and retired teachers, scientists, 
Government/semi-Government officials, retired armed forces personnel, self-employed 
and salaried professionals, homemakers, persons from the Indian diaspora and any other 
organisation/group or company – directly with schools of their choice.
The Volunteers play a crucial role by bringing innovative teaching methods and interactive 
activities that foster creative thinking among students. Further, resourceful schools can also 
contribute their expertise and resources to schools that require additional support under the 
twinning of the school’s feature under the programme.

Impact of Vidyanjali
The Vidyanjali initiative has played a crucial role in enhancing the educational experiences 
of over 1.44 crore students by facilitating comprehensive community engagement and 
leveraging volunteer contributions across various domains, including subject assistance 
and mentoring and the provision of modern electronics and digital devices. This extensive 
volunteer involvement has enriched students’ learning with diverse resources ranging from 
subject assistance and mentoring for gifted children to the provision of modern electronics 
and digital devices such as mobile phones and computers. Additionally, volunteers have 
supplied essential items like first aid kits and sports equipment and even transformed 
learning spaces with smart classrooms and upgraded kitchen gardens.
The initiative has successfully met many asset requests, with 26,268 requests completed. 
These requests encompass a variety of essential items and facilities crucial for enhancing the 
educational environment, such as basic electrical infrastructure, classroom needs, health 
and safety aids, etc. In addition to asset requests, the programme has completed 13,100 
activities, each possibly extending over multiple days or tasks. Success stories include Delhi, 
which has demonstrated exemplary participation with 2883 out of 2969 schools registered, 
along with 14,882 active Volunteers.
Progress in school infrastructure
7.54	 Basic facilities in schools continued to improve in FY 23 over earlier years. Toilets (girls 
or boys), drinking water, and hand-washing facilities are now available in most Government 
schools. Priority to drinking water and sanitation in schools under the Samagra Shiksha Scheme 
and the Swachh Bharat Mission have been instrumental in providing required resources and 
creating these school assets. Under the Information & Communication Technology (ICT) 
component of the Samagra Shiksha Scheme, the Government supports the establishment of 
smart classrooms and ICT labs in schools, including support for hardware, educational software, 
and e-content for teaching.

National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023
7.55	 Launched in August 2023, the NCF-SE 2023 brings to life the aims and commitment of 
NEP 2020 by enabling its implementation. The NCF was drafted by a 12-member National 
Steering Committee and sought inputs from around 16 lakh diverse stakeholders, including 
teachers, parents, students, educational institutions, neo- and non-literates, subjects’ experts, 
scholars, Anganwadi personnel, etc., from across the country.
7.56	 The NCF-2023 improves upon its predecessor, NCF-2005, in several ways, including, 
inter alia, promoting competency-based education54, introducing vocational education from 
grade 3 rather than grade 9, learning languages native to India, and charting a comprehensive 
roadmap for ECCE and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). This is transformational 
as FLN is a pre-requisite for instilling value into further years of school education and hence 
in realising learning outcomes (Muralidharan 2024)55. Besides, it brings more clarity, details, 
and direction on integrating Indigenous knowledge in the school curriculum, using education 
technology, including ICT, and moving away from rote memorisation.
54  Competency-based education is an approach that focuses on the development and demonstration of specific 
skills, knowledge, abilities, and dispositions, rather than solely relying on rote memorization.

Vocational Education
7.57	 Vocational education has received focused attention in the NEP 2020, which mandates 
its mainstreaming in all institutions, with focus areas based on skills gap analysis and mapping 
of local job opportunities. This includes the development of pre-vocational capacities in 
children in the Foundational and preparatory stages and exposure to work in the middle stage, 
thus equipping them to achieve vocation-specific capacities/skills in the secondary stage in 
accordance with their aptitude, competence, and aspirations.
7.58	 Under the Samagra Shiksha Scheme, a non-recurring grant for purchasing tools and 
equipment, including furniture, computers, etc., is given to states/UTs to augment school 
infrastructure and accommodate vocational education. Assistance is also provided for capacity 
building of teachers/skill trainers, development of competency-based curriculum and teaching 
learning material, development of management information system, etc. States/UTs can choose 
from NSQF-compliant 113 job roles in 22 sectors.56
7.59	 In terms of progress achieved, 29,342 Schools have been covered under skill education 
from FY19 to FY24 (till March 2024). 22 sectors with 88 job roles were covered under Skill 
education till FY24. A total of 25 new job roles were introduced in FY24 under the Hub and 
scope model, under which infrastructure of the hub schools can be utilised by the nearby 
spoke schools, 1011 spoke schools have been approved. Exposure of skill education to upper 
primary students has been approved for 1,08,418 schools for FY25, and exposure has been 
given to 3643981 students. Employability skill modules, including communication skills, self-
management skills, ICT skills, entrepreneurship skills, and green skills, have been included in 
the job roles curriculum. 
Higher Education
7.60	 The higher education sector, comprising tertiary and post-school learning in universities 
and other institutions, has witnessed an acceleration in total enrolment coupled with rising 
‘enrolment equity’ over the past eight years. As per AISHE 2021-2257, total enrolment in higher 
education has increased to nearly 4.33 crore in FY22 from 4.14 crore in FY21 and 3.42 crore in 
FY15 (an increase of 26.5 per cent since FY15). 
56  The 22 sectors are: Aerospace and Aviation, Agriculture, Apparel Made ups & Home Furnishing, Automotive, 
Banking Finance and Insurance Services (BFSI), Beauty and Wellness, Construction, Electronics & Hardware, 
Handicrafts and Carpets, Healthcare, Information Technology/Information Technology Enabled Services (IT/
ITeS), Management & Entrepreneurship, Media & Entertainment, Food Industry, Physical Education & Sports, 
Plumber, Power, Retail, Security, Telecom, Tourism & Hospitality, Transportation Logistics & Warehousing.
57  All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) is the only comprehensive survey by the Ministry of Education 
(MoE) to capture the data on Higher Education in the country since 2011 to create a robust and inclusive database 
for Higher Education. Information in AISHE 2021-22 is related to financial year 2021-22, i.e. From 1st April

Rising equity in higher education
7.61	 The rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections 
such as SC, ST and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolment across sections. Female 
enrolment in higher education increased to 2.07 crore in FY22 from 1.57 crore in FY15, i.e., 
a 31.6 per cent increase since FY15. The growing equity in higher education implies better 
employment opportunities for the hitherto backward sections.

Re-imagining lifelong learning through a digital prism
7.62	 India has 26.52 crore students in school, 4.33 crore in higher education and more than 11 
crore learners in skilling institutions. The vast expanse of the educational landscape comprises 
14.89 lakh schools, 1.50 lakh secondary schools, 1.42 lakh higher secondary schools58, 1,168 
Universities, 45,473 colleges, 12,002 standalone institutions59, 94.8 lakh teachers in school 
education and 15.98 lakh teachers in higher education. 
7.63	 These sweeping figures put into perspective the enormity of the challenge and the 
inherent ambition of the NEP 2020 to transform India’s educational ecosystem. NEP lies at 
the heart of efforts towards strengthening institutional capacity to embed lifelong learning in 
the education and skills ecosystem. It calls for interconnectedness of initiatives across formal, 
non-formal, and informal modes to make learning systems more holistic, multidisciplinary, 
and comprehensive to address diverse learning needs. 
7.64	 The National Credit Framework (NCrF), announced under NEP in April 2023, forms the 
bulwark of the regulatory architecture underpinning life-long learning. Bolstering the regulatory 
architecture is an extensive array of digital solutions, such as digital public infrastructure (DPI), 
which act as force multipliers. Prime among India’s educational DPIs is APAAR, i.e. Automated 
Permanent Academic Account Registry, which serves as an electronic registry for institutions, 
students, and faculty by creating unique identities and lifelong academic credentials for each 
stakeholder in the education space. APAAR is supplemented by the Academic Bank of Credits 
(ABC), an online repository of academic credits that facilitates students’ mobility across Higher 
58  https://dashboard.udiseplus.gov.in/#/reportDashboard/sDashboard 
59  https://tinyurl.com/4sp5tkpz

Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal process of credit recognition, accumulation, 
transfer and redemption. Once an APAAR ID is created, HEIs map the credits a student earns 
to their ID, with all such credits stored in the ABC in demat form. 
7.65	 The twin solution of APAAR and ABC, by allowing real-time verification of identity and 
academic credentials, paves the way for several interesting use cases. These include the possibility 
of students pursuing credit courses from different institutions for a particular qualification (now 
a reality) or targeting scholarships/ internships/ educational loans using academic profiles. 
With the data consent layer built into these DPIs, an exciting world of possibilities opens where 
the data principal (students) can share their academic credentials with prospective employers 
or institutions for internships, jobs or collaborative opportunities. As of July 2024, 2037 HEIs 
have onboarded ABC, and 30.13 crore APAAR IDs have been created for students of higher 
education, school education and skill institutes.60 
7.66	 India’s online learning architecture has been instrumental in creditisation, with University 
Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations enabling students to earn up to 40 per cent of credits 
from online courses. Box VII.7 below gives a detailed list of major initiatives in this regard.
Box VII.7: India’s online learning architecture
Powered by the combination of Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds 
(SWAYAM), SWAYAM PRABHA and SWAYAM Plus, indigenously crafted platforms have

Way forward in education
7.67	 As education is one of the most critical areas for India’s development, mission-mode and 
cost-effective implementation of well-designed and well-intentioned programmes is essential 
to improve the quality of education, especially primary education, without which further years 
of education add little value. To realise the same, unity of purpose and convergence of efforts 
across the centre, state, and local Governments is called for, as ‘public education’ is a concurrent 
list subject.
7.68	 To operationalise vocational education across the learning ladder, the model of Lend 
A Hand India (LAHI), an NGO, is a good example. The LAHI model includes civil society’s 
collaboration with the Governments to introduce vocational education as a core curriculum 
component, establish labs, recruit and train vocational trainers, organise internships, and offer 
placement support. By providing comprehensive vocational education services and engaging 
with key stakeholders, civil society can play an active role in implementing the novel features of 
NEP 2020.
7.69	 Increasing the cost-effectiveness of public spending on education requires spending on 
pedagogy and governance. This can include filling supervisory positions to monitor teaching 
quality, recognition of good and bad teacher performance, and hiring of local volunteers to 
ensure ‘teaching at the right level’ as textbook completion means little if children are way 
behind curricular standards (Muralidharan 2024)62
India making headway in R&D 
7.70	 Research and Development (R&D) is an important source of innovation, progress and 
increased productivity in an economy. In economics, the endogenous growth theory highlights 
the long-run economic growth to be determined by the rate of technological progress, alluding 
to the ultimate sway of R&D on a nation’s progress. R&D provides businesses with the technical 
know-how to improve productivity, reduce operating costs and raise competitiveness.63 In

emerging areas such as AI, environment sciences, biotechnology, etc. R&D serves both economic 
and strategic interests. 
7.71	 India is making rapid progress in R&D, with nearly one lakh patents granted in FY2464, 
compared to less than 25,000 patent grants in FY20.65 According to WIPO, India saw the 
highest growth (31.6 per cent) in patent filings in 202266, demonstrating its evolving innovation 
landscape and potential for further growth in intellectual property creation. India has 
consistently improved its rank in the Global Innovation Index from 81st position in 2015 to 40th 
in 2023, as per GII (2023).67 On the human resource side, total Ph.D. enrolment in India has 
increased to 81.2 per cent in FY22 (2.13 lakh) from FY15 (1.17 lakh).68 The Gross Expenditure 
on R&D (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years and has more 
than doubled from₹60,196.8 crore in FY11 to ₹ 127,381 crore in FY21 (Chart VII.8).

7.73	 However, India’s R&D investment as a percentage of GDP stands at 0.64 per cent, 
compared to China (2.41 per cent), the US (3.47 per cent), and Israel (5.71 per cent). Moreover, 
the private sector’s contribution to R&D remains low at 36.4 per cent of the country’s GERD 
compared to China (77 per cent), US (75 per cent), etc.72. 
7.74	 To better translate GERD to research output, the link between higher education, industry 
and research must be strengthened. Another challenge is low ‘Land to Lab’ time. Institutions 
in India develop technologies, but their transformation rate from the lab to the society for the 
benefit of the people remains low.73 
7.75	 Several efforts are underway to attract research personnel and create adequate opportunities 
in the research ecosystem of the nation. The ease of doing research is being bolstered through 
streamlining of patent grants, leading to a drastic reduction in the average time taken for 
examination of a patent application from 72 months in 2015 to between 5 to 23 months in 
2022, depending upon fields of technology.74 The Government has recently decided to increase 
the scholarships for students pursuing PhD and Post-Doctoral research.75 Further, India has 
launched its own National Research Foundation called ‘Anusandhan’76 operationalised by the 
Department of Science and Technology (under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation 
Act, 2023 Act77). This foundation will act as an apex body that aims to strengthen and promote 
the R&D ecosystem. In the interim budget of FY25, the Government also announced a corpus 
of 1 lakh crore for research and innovation in the country, adopting the slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai 
Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan”.
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN
7.76	 India is transitioning from women’s development to women-led development with the 
vision of a new India where women are equal partners in the story of growth and national 
progress. To realise the clarion call to Nari Shakti, the Government has made various legislative 
interventions and enabling provisions to ensure women’s participation in various professions. 
7.77	 India’s G20 Presidency in 2023 also listed ‘women-led development’ as one of its six 
priorities amid rising global attention towards women’s workforce participation. With the award 
of the Noble Prize in Economics to Prof. Claudia Goldin for her work on key drivers of gender 
differences in the labour market, the widespread recognition of gender issues is apparent.
7.78	 The issues affecting women range from lack of basic necessities such as sanitation, piped 
water, menstrual hygiene etc., safety, proper nutrition, economic and political equality of 
opportunity, and a sense of individual identity. Transitioning from women’s development to 
women-led development requires a 360-degree review of the issues and a sincere, pragmatic 
approach to tackling them.

7.79	 With this intent, the Government of India has undertaken multipronged initiatives to 
improve the well-being of women in the socio-political and economic context. 
Steady Rise in Gender Budget
7.80	 Over the years, the element of women-centricity in Government initiatives has been rising 
and is visible in the expanding gender budget. In FY14, the Government provisioned ₹97,134 
crore (BE) on the schemes for the welfare and empowerment of women, which has consistently 
increased over the years and reached ₹3.10 lakh crore in FY25. This shows a 38.7 per cent rise 
in the Gender Budget Statement (GBS)78 vis-à-vis FY24 BE and a 218.8 per cent increase over 
FY14 BE. The share of the Gender Budget in the total Union Budget has increased to 6.5 per 
cent in FY25, the highest since the introduction of GBS in FY06.79
Social empowerment of women
7.81	 Women-led development begins with ensuring the health and education of the girl child. 
The emphasis on “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” has sensitised collective consciousness towards 
cherishing, educating, and saving for the girl child (via Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana)80. The sex 
ratio at birth (SRB) at the national level has improved from 918 (2014-15) to 930 (2023-24, 
provisional),81 and the maternal mortality rate has declined from 130/lakh live births in 2014-
16 to 97/lakh live births in 2018-20.82
7.82	 Over the last decade, the prevalence of institutional delivery has increased from 78.9 per 
cent in 2015-16 to 88.6 per cent in 2019-21.83 Besides a rise in incomes and awareness of health 
practices, the positive trend is attributable to the Government’s programme to incentivise 
institutional delivery through Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram. The PM Matru Vandana 
Yojana84, entailing a cash payment of ₹ 5000 for the birth of the first child and ₹6000 for second 
child who is female, encourages proper rest for the new mothers by partially compensating for 
any wage loss. Called India’s largest conditional cash transfer programme ever, the scheme has 
been empirically associated with positive side effects of rise in long-term utilisation of public 
health services and increasing the interval between births (Haaren and Klonner 2021).85
Nutritional security of women and children through Anganwadi centres 
7.83	 The nutritional status of women is doubly important – first, for their own health, 
productivity, and well-being, and second, for preventing malnutrition in their young ones. 
Women’s health thus forms the bedrock of societal health. In recognition of this, the Mission

Saksham Anganwadi & Poshan 2.0 programme endeavours to address malnutrition in pregnant 
women, lactating mothers, children, and adolescent girls by adopting a lifecycle approach to 
achieve a malnutrition-free India.
7.84	 As an integrated nutrition support programme86, it shifts the focus from calorific 
sufficiency alone to improved health, wellness, and immunity through micronutrient sufficiency. 
It also includes awareness building on infant and young child feeding practices (including 
breastfeeding and complementary nutrition), maternal and adolescent nutrition, treatment 
of malnourished children, and promoting AYUSH practices. The programme lays thrust on 
improvement in process (using growth measurement devices, equipping Anganwadi workers 
with smartphones, using Poshan Tracker87 for real-time progress and dynamic identification 
of malnutrition) and behavioural change through community-based events such as Poshan 
Maah and Poshan Pakhwada, and counselling on health practices. In a further widening of 
their ambit, Anganwadi centres are being upgraded to Saksham Anganwadis88, equipped with 
LED screens, audio-visual teaching aids, Poshan Vatikas, rainwater harvesting structures, etc., 
to act as institutions of early childhood care and education for all children. 
7.85	 The battle against Kuposhan stands to benefit from the participation of Panchayat and 
women’s collectives, as exemplified in Odisha’s case, where Jaanch Committees and Mothers 
Committees have been set up at the village level to monitor and strengthen the services provided 
by the ICDS program. The Mothers Committees ensure the quality of meals at AWCs, while 
the Jaanch Committees oversee the feeding programs’ quality and quantity accreditation. This 
setup enhances the accountability of SHGs and increases trust in the safety of the provided 
food.89
7.86	 Access to basic necessities: For women-led development to even begin, gender-specific 
disadvantages affecting a large section of women belonging to rural and low-income households 
need to be tackled first. Towards this goal, the construction of toilets under ‘Swachh Bharat 
Mission’, the provision of clean cooking gas connections under ‘Ujjawala Yojana’ and the 
provision of tap drinking water connections under ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ have transformed the 
lives of women by reducing the drudgery and care burden. These initiatives, besides addressing 
concerns of safety and dignity, also free up time and energy for productive work such as 
participation in women’s collectives through National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).

distress to seek justice and rebound from adversity. The 24-hour toll-free women’s helpline 
‘181’92 offers prompt response on Government schemes and emergency services.
7.88	 Education and Skilling: India has a long history of social reform movements advocating 
women’s education, with Savitribai Phule93 stating in the 19th century that “…a woman without 
education is like a banyan tree without roots or leaves.” Women’s education continues to be an 
instrument of empowerment in terms of decision-making, intra-household bargaining power, 
control over resources, and political engagement (Engida 2017).94 Sinha (2023) attributes the 
high rate of human development indicators in southern states of India to high female enrolment 
in secondary education, which propelled the participation of a sizeable chunk of aware and 
confident women in development work and self-help groups.95 
7.89	 In terms of enrolment in schools, gender parity has been achieved at all levels96 with the 
implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (launched in 2000) and the Right to Education 
Act 2009. In higher education, the female GER has been greater than male GER for five 
consecutive years.97 While this implies rising importance of girls’ education, its translation to 
economic empowerment will require better learning outcomes, employability, labour force 
participation and conducive infrastructure. 
7.90	 The skilling schemes put a special focus on covering women. Under PMKVY, the 
participation of women among those trained has increased from 42.7 per cent in FY16 to 52.3 
per cent in FY24. Under the Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme, women constituted about 
82 per cent of the total beneficiaries. In the long-term ecosystem, i.e., in ITIs and National 
Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs), the participation of women has gone up from 9.8 per cent in 
FY16 to 13.3 per cent in FY24. Under NAPS, the participation of women also increased from 
7.7 per cent in FY17 to 20.8 per cent in FY24. However, to materialise the gains from skilling 
programmes, they need to be complemented with supportive infrastructure such as safe and 
affordable transport and logistics, creches, and long-term career counselling.
7.91	 Women in Science: According to World Bank data for 201898, India has among the highest 
proportion of female Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates, at 
42.7 per cent. However, the share of female scientists in Research and Development is only 18.6 
per cent.99 To rectify this contrast, the umbrella scheme ‘Women in Science and Engineering-
KIRAN (WISE KIRAN)’ strives to boost the involvement of women in STEM fields. Between

2018 and 2023, nearly 1962 women scientists benefitted under the Women Scientist Scheme, 
which provides opportunities for women scientists, especially those with a career break. The 
Vigyan Jyoti programme, initiated in 2020, aims to address the underrepresentation of girls in 
various science and technology courses from 9th to 12th grades. As of December 2023, around 
21,600 female students of Class IX-XII from 250 districts are enrolled under this programme. 
In April 2023, the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) started exclusive Research 
Grants for Women Scientists under CSIR-ASPIRE and dedicated an exclusive portal. Women’s 
leadership in cutting-edge space research programmes like the Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 
solar missions reflects the ongoing gender transformation in niche scientific sectors. 
7.92	 Breaking into male bastions: The Government has also made enabling provisions 
allowing women’s participation in non-conventional sectors such as fighter pilots in the Indian 
Air Force, Commandos, Central Police Forces, admissions in Sainik Schools, etc. 
7.93	 Political empowerment: In the arena of public life and political empowerment, the Nari 
Shakti Vandan Abhiniyam, 2023 (NSVA) is a leap towards women’s political participation, 
empirically associated with improved institutions and greater integrity. In Indian history, the 
reservation of one-third of seats for women in Panchayats was constitutionalised in 1991, and 
three decades later, 46 per cent of elected representatives of Panchayats are women. According 
to research, reservations for women in panchayats have led to greater investment in public 
goods closely linked to women’s concerns, such as drinking water and public roads.100 Besides, 
female political representation is also associated with better child health101 and primary 
education outcomes.102 Along those lines, the NSVA opens new possibilities for inclusive growth 
besides being a beacon of gender equality. 
7.94	 Transformation of the feminine identity: Nari Shakti begins with the recognition of 
women as individuals with an independent identity. The significance of this can be seen in an 
interesting example in history. In 1952, when the Election Commission of India was preparing 
for the first general elections in independent India, nearly 28 lakh women enrolled not using 
their proper names but as a mother/wife of someone, leading to the invalidation of their voter 
registration.103 The India of today has come far ahead, and multiple steps have been taken to 
strengthen the identity of women citizens, recent ones including the issuance of ration card in 
the name of the eldest woman of the household under NFSA, 2013104, requirement of female’s 
joint or sole ownership of houses constructed under PM Awas Yojana105, reaching more than 25 
crore unbanked women through the Jan Dhan Yojana106, and collectivisation of nearly 10 crore 
rural women under SHGs107.

Economic empowerment of women
7.95	 Rising participation in the labour force: Increased access to education and skill 
development, as well as other initiatives for women’s empowerment, has elevated the 
participation of women in the nation’s development and progress. The female LFPR rose to 
37 per cent in 2022-23 from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18. However, rural India has driven the 
trend, where nearly three-fourths of the women workers are engaged in agriculture-related 
work. Thus, the rise in LFPR needs to be tapped into higher value-addition sectors suitable to 
the needs and qualifications of the rural female workforce, and agro-processing emerges as a 
good contender for the same, as discussed in the chapter on Employment. The role of valuable 
employment in changing girls’ image from liability to breadwinner is exemplified in the story 
of Krishnagiri district in Tamil Nadu, discussed in Box VII.8. 
Box VII.8: Girls of Krishnagiri writing their own destinies with the ink of 
financial independence108
A recent spate of industrial investment in the last decade has led to significant job creation for 
females in Krishnagiri, a remote district in Tamil Nadu, catalysing a positive socioeconomic 
chain reaction. The experience shows how women’s financial independence is deeply linked 
with their overall development, besides being a pivot for social change.
The district was reeling under a high incidence of child marriage, prenatal sex selection, a 
low child-sex ratio (of 920, compared to the state average of 946)109, and low female literacy 
(at 65 per cent)110. 
The setup of manufacturing units in electronics, mobile assembly, electric scooters, 
footwear, etc., has favoured large-scale employment of women, as manufacturers believed 
female workers to be more productive and dexterous. This triggered a mindset shift as 
households who considered girls a burden now view them as breadwinners, besides 
bolstering Government welfare efforts towards female empowerment. This has resulted in a 
declining incidence of child marriage and school dropout rates of girls, a rise in the average 
age of marriage, coupled with a surge in female enrolment in polytechnic institutes. 
The Krishnagiri experience also spurred second-order effects from the state and corporates. 
The state Government-initiated policies on providing career guidance in Government 
schools from class 9th itself, setting up industrial hostels, counselling parents, etc. The rising 
demand for female employees has also instilled hiring competition among companies, luring 
their workforce with better pay and relaxation in education criteria by introducing on-the-
job training, pick-up and drop facilities, daycare facilities, etc.
7.96	 To truly realise the gender dividend of workforce participation by an increasingly educated 
and skilled female population, proper development of the care economy is essential and long 
pending, as discussed in the following chapter on Employment.

7.97	 Financial Inclusion: Access to financial services improves women’s control over household 
resources and is a gateway to accessing credit and insurance. The PM Jan Dhan Yojana has 
facilitated the opening of 52.3 crore bank accounts, of which 55.6 per cent of accountholders 
are women as of May 2024. This is accompanied by a rise in average deposits by nearly four 
times, from ₹1,065 in March 2015 to ₹4,398 in May 2024. 
7.98	 Rural Microfinance: The Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- NRLM, which is the Government’s 
Self-Help Groups (SHGs)111 programme covering more than 89 million women into 8.3 
million SHGs112, has been empirically associated with women empowerment, self-esteem 
enhancement, personality development, reduced social evils, and medium impacts in terms of 
better education, higher participation in village institutions and better access to Government 
schemes. The mission also emphasises social capital and inter-regional knowledge sharing and 
handholding by community resource persons (CRPs), who are women who have emerged out of 
poverty through hard work and enterprise. Called the foot soldiers of the livelihood movement, 
more than 3.5 crore CRPs (comprising Krishi Sakhis, Pashu Sakhis, Bank Sakhis, Bima Sakhis, 
Banking Correspondent Sakhis) are instrumental in implementing and scaling up SHGs113. 
Success stories include Kudumbashree in Kerala, Jeevika in Bihar, Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahila 
Mandal in Maharashtra, and recently, Looms of Ladakh. The programme is discussed in further 
detail in Box VII.10 of this chapter.
7.99	 Entrepreneurship: Female participation has been quite encouraging in the wave of 
entrepreneurship through Start-up and Stand-Up India. Around 68 per cent of the loans have 
been sanctioned to women entrepreneurs under PM Mudra Yojana, and 77.7 per cent of the 
beneficiaries under Stand-Up India are women, as of May 2024.114 Realising the vision of 
Digital India, more than 53 per cent of the Prime Minister’s Rural Digital Literacy Campaign 
(PMGDISHA) beneficiaries are women (as of July 2023). Bain and Co. (2020) estimate that 
there are roughly 13.5-15.7 million women-owned businesses in India, making up 17-20 per 
cent of the country’s total enterprises. With more encouragement and support, this number can 
increase to 31.5 million, i.e., one-third of all enterprises, by 2030, as per estimates.115
Towards equality of asset ownership
7.100  Although the social acceptance of women breaking into traditionally male domains such 
as flying a fighter plane, running a unicorn company, or leading a district/department has been 
rising with such news being celebrated, much scope remains in enhancing asset ownership 
among women and normalising female property rights. Besides the intrinsic moral worth of 
equality, female ownership of land/assets is crucial for their financial security and utilisation of 
economic opportunities, enabling rural women’s control over resources for farming and related 
loans and household well-being through family-oriented rather than personal use of resources

(Agarwal 1994)116. Property ownership has even been associated with decreased spousal 
violence (Agarwal and Panda, 2007)117. In spite of women-friendly legislation on succession, 
research estimates that only 14 per cent of landowners in nine sample states118 of India were 
women119 (Agarwal, Anthwal, and Mahesh, 2021). Even landowning women are found to face 
multiple issues, such as limited access to single titles, and smaller and inferior quality land120 
(Jain, Saxena, Sen, and Sanan, 2023).
7.101  The requirement of female ownership of houses constructed under PM AWAS Yojana121 
is an effort by the state to nudge social change towards gender equity. Yet, broader progress will 
have to emerge from the grassroots, and, borrowing from the wisdom of literature published 
half a century ago, “Indicators of social acceptance of any goals set for the future must include 
attitudes of men and women as well as the availability of institutionalised infrastructures 
that support the attainment of such goals”.122 Substantive equality in asset ownership would 
indeed be a high point in actualising the independent identity of women. For development to 
be led by women, it will also have to be ‘owned’ by them.
RURAL ECONOMY: DRIVING THE GROWTH ENGINE
7.102  The integrated and sustainable development of rural India is at the heart of the 
Government’s governance strategy. The focus is on holistic economic betterment through 
decentralised planning, better access to credit, skilling of youth, enhanced livelihood 
opportunities, empowerment of women, social security net provision, basic housing, education, 
health, and sanitation facilities, etc. Thrust on welfare services like school infrastructure, primary 
healthcare centres, technology solutions to issues of governance, improved means of transport 
and communications, etc., is aimed at equipping the populace with long-term capabilities 
for living the kind of lives they value. This section presents some of the Government’s rural 
development policies and programmes.

Strengthening and modernising the safety net of MGNREGS 
7.105  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA) 
aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing 
at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose 
adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.139

wages are transferred under DBT, Aadhaar-based payment has been enabled in 98.6 per cent 
of total Active workers, and Social Audit units have been set up in 28 states/UT. 
7.108	  While MGNREGS began as a wage employment scheme, it has evolved into an asset-
creation programme for sustainable livelihood diversification, as seen in the rise in the share 
of individual beneficiary ‘works on individual land’ from 9.6 per cent of total completed works 
in FY14 to 73.3 per cent in FY24 (the share in terms of expenditure is much lower, yet rose 
from 6.1 per cent in FY14 to 32.1 per cent in FY22). Capacity development of workers is being 
promoted initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT)141  and UNNATI142  skilling project.

borne by the Central Government. This project was launched in FY20 and aims to enhance the skill base of 2 
lakh Mahatma Gandhi NREGA beneficiaries in three years, i.e., FY20, FY21 and FY22. So far, about 59,350

7.110  Box VII.9 examines whether spending on MGNREGS is an indicator of rural distress.
Box VII.9: Is MGNREGS spending an indicator of rural distress?
There is a marked variation in the performance of the MGNREGS across states. Multiple 
research studies143,144,145 have been conducted to find a definite cause for such unevenness 
in outcomes but a satisfactory explanation has not been found. Some reports146,147 suggest 
that MGNREGS demand is indicative of rural distress. If this is indeed the case then data 
trends should show that States with more poverty and higher unemployment rates use more 
Scheme funds and generate more employment person-days. Additionally, there might be a 
correlation between MGNREGS fund usage and reduced unemployment. MGNREGS wages 
could reflect state poverty levels. Past studies148 have attempted to correlate MGNREGS 
demand with weather data to indicate real-time rural distress, but the hypothesis needs 
verification.
Insights from MGNREGS Data 
Data for FY24149 shows that although Tamil Nadu has less than 1 per cent of the country’s 
poor population,150 it accounted for nearly 15 per cent of all MGNREGS funds released. 
Similarly, Kerala, with only 0.1 per cent of the poor population, used almost 4 per cent of 
the Nation’s MGNREGS funds. Together, these states generated 51 crore person-days of 
employment. In contrast, Bihar and UP, with about 45 per cent (20 per cent and 25 per cent 
respectively) of the poor population, accounted for only 17 per cent (6 per cent and 11 per 
cent respectively) of MGNREGA funds and generated 53 crore person-days of employment 
(Chart VII.12).

The correlation coefficient between state-wise multidimensional poverty index and person-

Additionally, calculations reveal that there is little correlation between MGNREGS fund 
usage and rural unemployment rates. Data from FY23153 shows that states with the highest 
rural unemployment rates did not necessarily use the most MGNREGS funds. Contrary 
to the popular narrative, the data does not support the idea that states with high rural 
unemployment rates in FY22 sought more MGNREGS funds in FY23 (Chart VII.13).
Under the MGNREGA, unless a national minimum wage is set (which the Act permits), states 
can set their own minimum wage. This fixation should ideally consider local employment 
opportunities, per-capita incomes, and alternate income sources. However, scheme data154 
reveals that minimum wage fixation is ad-hoc and not correlated with per-capita income or 
poverty headcount ratio. States such as Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and others 
have relatively high notified wage rates in MGNREGA (Chart VII.14), relative to their per-
capita incomes. This significantly impacts state-wise MGNREGS fund usage, as the wage 
component is fully borne by the Central Government.

Diagnosis of the factors that explain differences in MGNREGA work demands 
across States
It is evident from the data above that MGNREGS work demand does not directly correlate 
with increased rural distress at a micro level. The remarkable evolution of MGNREGS 
work from being the last resort of village-resident families to becoming more of a smart 
choice for household asset creation and sustainable income generation has also been noted 
previously.155 This indicates that other important aspects must be factored in to explain the 
State level differences in fund usage. Some of these are discussed below.
Supply-side issues
Difference in time taken by DoRD to release funds to different States- The automated 
process by DoRD ensures no significant variation in fund release times to different States, 
indicating that this is not a cause of state-wise differences in fund usage.
Appropriation of MGNREGA budget between states- Differences in MGNREGS fund usage 
could likely stem from projected annual demands in the agreed labour budgets. Projections156 
for FY25 show that states with a high rural poor population157, like UP, MP, and Bihar, will 
have higher annual person-days. Thus, the variance is likely due to actual fund usage based 
on the work completed.
Demand-side issues
State’s institutional capacity to tap benefits under the MGNREGS- To access MGNREGS 
funds, state governments must finalise labour budgets for the upcoming financial year in 
advance, following a bottom-up planning process. This includes Gram Panchayat meetings, 
approvals at Block and District levels, and compilation at the State level. States must utilize 
at least 75 per cent of the previous year’s funds, provide utilisation certificates, expenditure 
statements, and social audit achievements to apply for fund tranches.158  States with better 
institutional capacities and trained functionaries can complete this process on time.
Literature159,160,161 establishes a link between per-capita income and institutional quality. 
States with lower per-capita incomes and higher poverty levels often have weaker institutions, 
thereby tapping fewer funds per work executed and generating less employment per capita 
for the rural poor.162 FY24 data163 shows that states like UP (~10 lakh works), Karnataka

(~9 lakh works), and MP (~7.77 lakh works) executed many works but used fewer MGNREGA 
funds per work (₹0.93 lakh, ₹0.55 lakh and ₹0.72 lakhs respectively). Conversely, states like 
Puducherry (₹8.96 lakh per work), Haryana (₹. 4.89 lakh), Rajasthan (₹2.76 lakh), and 
Tamil Nadu (₹2 lakh) tapped more funds per work.
The trend is similar for person-days employment generated per capita of the rural poor, 
with Tamil Nadu (69), Kerala (62), Rajasthan (42), and Puducherry (30) outperforming UP 
(7), MP (10), and Bihar (6). States with higher institutional capacities plan and coordinate 
better, executing costlier works in rural infrastructure or natural resources management. 
In contrast, lower-income states like Assam, Jharkhand, Bihar, UP, Chhattisgarh, MP, and 
Rajasthan have a higher proportion of “individual works”164 (50 per cent or more), which are 
less costly and require less planning.
Thus, a state’s institutional capacity is crucial for effectively tapping MGNREGS funds.
Differences in registering demand- Despite provisions mandating State governments to grant 
unemployment allowance if work is not provided within 15 days, only ₹90,000 was released 
in FY 24 and ₹7.8 lakh in FY23 across all states.165 Further, evaluation reports166 indicate that 
employment was often unavailable when sought. This suggests that block-level functionaries 
may not register demand in real time. Consequently, formal data showing MGNREGS work 
demand may not reflect the true demand and current rural economic distress. This also 
indicates that work demanded is only reported on the portal when employment is actually 
provided (presumably to save on the State Government’s liability towards unemployment 
allowance). Hence work demanded on the portal is de-facto equivalent to work provided 
and not the “real” demand.
Increased leakages- Variations in MGNREGS fund usage arise from irregularities and 
leakages observed across states. Despite lacking exhaustive documentation, news reports167, 
social audits168 and anecdotal evidence suggests that funds often do not reach intended 
beneficiaries, making demand an unreliable distress indicator. Over four years, Social Audit 
Units found ₹935 crore misappropriated under MGNREGS. Instances of workers paying 
contractors and giving up job cards169; illegal use of machines instead of labour, unrealistic 
labour budgets, delays in fund release170, lack of job card updates and unverified bills have 
been reported from different regions. The Social Accountability Forum’s audit171 reported 
₹658 crore misappropriated over 2018-20, with grievances focusing on wage issues, job 
cards, and worksites. It also noted that transparency, accountability, and record-keeping 
processes were often violated in MGNREGA implementation.

From the above diagnostic analysis, it can be concluded that demand under MGNREGS 
is not a real indicator of rural distress but is rather predominantly linked with the State’s 
institutional capacity and to some extent also different minimum wages and other 
considerations.
Nurturing rural entrepreneurship at the grassroots
7.111  The Government has implemented a bouquet of vibrant schematic interventions with 
a distinct focus on seamless access to affordable finance and generating lucrative market 
opportunities that ultimately aim to provide a fillip to rural entrepreneurship. The Government 
remains committed to bolstering rural entrepreneurship and has been at the forefront of 
implementing a plethora of schemes aimed at livelihood generation, providing easy access 
to finance and marketing, and developing a common infrastructure for promoting rural 
entrepreneurship. Some of the schemes and programmes are mentioned in Box VII.10 below.
Box VII.10: Initiatives fostering rural entrepreneurship
(a)  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-
NRLM), for instance, is one of the world’s largest social sector schemes aiming to 
empower poor households to access meaningful self-employment and skilled wage 
employment opportunities. DAY- NRLM has helped women access scientific knowledge, 
specialised skills, and valuable exposure to motivate and ignite new energy to reform 
their livelihoods and venture into new activities. They have taken up enterprises like 
solar panels to prepare sanitary pads, soaps, detergents, face masks, sanitisers, fencing 
materials, etc. Initiated in 2011, the Mission has its footprint across 7135 blocks in 742 
districts of 28 states and 6 UTs. The progress of the programme on key components has 
been summarised below.

(b)  Lakhpati Didis initiative
    The Lakhpati Didis initiative, launched in 2023, targets to uplift three crore SHG 
households to a minimum annual income of ₹1 lakh within three years. It focuses on 
diversified livelihood activities, district-level planning, household support, Government 
department convergence, and capacity building of staff and community members.
(c)  Saras Aajeevika portal and eSARAS mobile App (launched in 2023) showcase a 
wide array of authentic handcrafted products, such as linen items, furniture, apparel, 
pickles, etc., made by SHGs. By creating a dedicated marketplace for their indigenously 
crafted products, the platform thus catalyses rural women into new-age entrepreneurs.
(d)  Start-Up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) and Aajeevika 
Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY) are being implemented as non-farm livelihood 
strategies under DAY-NRLM. SVEP supports entrepreneurs in rural areas in setting 
up local enterprises. The strategy is to promote knowledge about business feasibility 
management, provide start-up loan finance access, and scale up the existing enterprise. 
2.97 lakh enterprises have been formed in 221 blocks of 29 states/UT. AGEY provides 
safe, affordable and community-monitored transport services to rural areas. Around 
2333 vehicles are operational in 26 states, providing transport services to connect 
remote rural villages.
(e)  The Rural Self Employment Training Institute (RSETI) scheme, which is 
a sub-scheme of the NRLM, is also aimed at strengthening rural entrepreneurship. 
RSETIs are essentially district-level Self Employment Training Institutes in rural areas 
managed by the banks and funded by the Ministry of Rural Development. They provide 
free-of-cost skill training, credit assistance, and mentorship to rural unemployed youth 
aged 18-45 years, with an approach of short-term training & long-term hand-holding 
of entrepreneurs. Their tailor-made curriculum is designed to match the local demands   
of the agricultural economy and small rural businesses. Since the scheme’s inception in 
2009, 50.72 lakh candidates have been trained, and 36.23 lakh candidates have been 
settled as entrepreneurs/apprentices till June 2024, with a settlement rate of more 
than 72 per cent.
(f)  Financing rural entrepreneurship: To support rural entrepreneurs, the 
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) promotes Micro 
Entrepreneurship Development Programmes (MEDPs) and Livelihood & Enterprise 
Development Programmes (LEDPs), focusing on funding and skill improvement. 
NABARD backs SHGs, JLGs, POs, and Micro-entrepreneurs with training and helps 
them sell their products on online platforms and the Open Network for Digital 
Commerce (ONDC). Additionally, Off-Farm Producer Organisations (OFPOs) receive 
guidance to join ONDC. By 31 March 2023, around 5.85 lakh SHG members benefitted 
from 20,174 MEDPs, receiving ₹52.39 crore in grants, and 2.67 lakh SHG members 
from 2149 LEDPs, with ₹106.10 crore in grants.

Social Sector
265
(g)  The ‘SARAS Mela’ by the Ministry of Rural Development helps SHG beneficiaries 
sell their products directly in urban markets, eliminating middlemen and improving 
artisans’ margins. It allows rural producers to engage with buyers, tailor products to 
consumer preferences, and hone their marketing skills.
(h)  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): DDU-GKY 
is a state-led, outcome-driven skilling program focused on rural youth, emphasizing 
sustainable employment, PPP, and independent third-party certification of outcomes 
through Sector Skill Councils. The programme occupies a unique position amongst 
other skill training programmes due to its focus on the poor rural youth and its 
emphasis on sustainable employment through the prominence and incentives given to 
post-placement tracking, retention and career progression. Special sub-schemes called 
ROSHNI and Himayat are also being implemented. A total of 16.5 lakh candidates 
have been trained, and 10.48 lakh candidates placed under the scheme till June 2024 
(provisional).
7.112  Looking forward, the wide local presence of RSETIs (591 RSETIs functioning across 577 
districts of the country172) and tri-partnership of banks, state Governments, and the central 
Government can be leveraged to converge efforts across Government programmes such as 
skilling and livelihood diversification, farm mechanisation through Krishi Vigyan Kendra, job 
fairs, SHGs, farmer producer organisations, primary agricultural cooperative societies etc. By 
acting as the fulcrum of skill and credit linkage at the grassroots, RSETIs can thus emerge as 
district-level enterprise hubs.173
7.113  The potential of SHGs needs to be tapped by enabling their upscaling into larger 
enterprises, harnessing professional support and management. For instance, the mobilisation 
of tribal women into operating, managing, and owning solar lamp factories and retail solar 
shops in Dungarpur, Rajasthan, was made possible through handholding by Prof. Chetan 
Solanki of IIT Bombay and support by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and local 
administration.174 With proper training and professional guidance, women’s collectives can 
emerge as self-sustainable enterprises at scale.
Rural Governance: A story of digital transformations at the grass-
roots
7.114	Rural development has immense benefits to derive from better rural governance, which 
can serve as the foundation and multiplier force for both programme-led impact creation and 
individual-led utilisation of rising opportunities. With a 200 per cent increase in rural internet 
subscriptions between 2015 and 2021175, digitisation of governance is a low-hanging fruit to 
reduce the distance between the village and the administrative headquarters, which is crucial

in regional development.176 In this aspect, multiple digitisation initiatives have been unfolding 
in rural India.
Box VII.11: Digitisation initiatives to improve rural governance
e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project
The e-Panchayat project seeks to automate the internal workflow processes of approximately 
2.71 lakh Panchayats or equivalent bodies, benefiting around 30 lakh elected members and 
about ten lakh PRI functionaries. In addition, the Government has introduced an application 
called AuditOnline under the e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project to facilitate online audits of 
Panchayat accounts and maintain detailed records of internal and external audits. 177
e-Gram SWARAJ
On National Panchayati Raj Day on 24 April 2020, e-Gram SWARAJ (https://egramswaraj.
gov.in/) was launched to introduce digital Panchayats for rural India. The platform provides 
a complete profile of the Gram Panchayat, including demographic details, finances, and 
activities outlined in the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP). It also integrates 
with the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) to enable real-time payments and 
better financial management. 2.52 lakh Gram Panchayats have prepared and uploaded their 
GPDPs for FY24 on e-Gram SWARAJ.178
Bhu-Aadhaar
The Identification Parcel Number (ULPIN) or Bhu-Aadhaar is a 14-digit identification 
number assigned to a land parcel based on its longitude and latitude coordinates. It aims to 
facilitate demarcation, identification, and standardisation of land parcels, enabling different
Government departments to provide land-related services to citizens, including multi-
departmental services. Proper land statistics and land accounting through ULPIN would 
help develop land banks and an Integrated Land Information Management System (ILIMS). 
ULPIN has been rolled out in 29 states, generating approximately 14.94 crore ULPINs. 179
SVAMITVA Scheme
SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) 
is a Central Sector Scheme launched in 2020 to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to rural 
household owners. It aims to enable property monetization, reduce disputes, and facilitate 
comprehensive village-level planning. The drone survey has been completed in 2.90 lakh 
villages and 1.66 crore property cards have been prepared for 1.06 lakh villages. The scheme 
has been implemented in Haryana, Uttarakhand, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar 
Islands, and Goa.180

TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
7.115  With less than six years remaining for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), the Government of India has been at the forefront in embracing, adopting, and 
championing the SDGs to improve the welfare and quality of life for its citizens. Despite the 
global economy facing multiple headwinds, India has made steady progress towards achieving 
the 2030 Agenda, showcasing the nation's resilience and commitment to SDGs. According to 
the progress report on SDGs by NITI Aayog through the SDG India Index, India has significantly 
improved in meeting these goals despite global challenges. Targeted interventions such as 
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Jan Dhan Yojana, 
Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY, Ayushman Arogya Mandir, PM-Mudra Yojana, Saubhagya, and 
Start-up India have had significant impacts and led to rapid improvements.
7.116  India’s progress in achieving SDGs has advanced with each year. The performance is 
measured for 16 quantifiable goals, and a qualitative assessment is provided for Goal 17. The 
country’s overall score/composite score181 measured by the SDG India Index has ascended from 
57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20, 66 in 2020-21 to 71 in 2023-24. India has taken significant strides 
in accelerating progress on the SDGs between the 2020-21 and 2023-24 editions of the Index. 
7.117  Since 2018, India has witnessed substantial progress in several key SDGs. Significant 
progress has been made in Goals 1 (No Poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 6 (Clean Water 
and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 
and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) (Chart VII.15).

7.118  The SDG India Index 2023-24 reports a positive trend in the performance of States and 
UTs in their SDG journey. The scores for States now range from 57 to 79, while UTs score 
between 65 and 77. This year, 32 States/UTs have scored between 65 and 99, up from 22 in the 
2020-21 edition.

Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar 
Pradesh, West Bengal, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. The SDG India Index 
2023-24 demonstrates the increase in composite scores across all States, with improvements 
ranging from 1 to 8 points. 
7.120  Between 2018 and 2023-24, fastest moving States are Uttar Pradesh (increase in score 
by 25), followed by J&K (21), Uttarakhand (19), Sikkim (18), Haryana (17), Assam, Tripura and 
Punjab (16 each), Madhya Pradesh and Odisha (15 each).

Social Sector
269
CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD
7.121  The Indian economy is moving forward with a reformed approach to welfare, focused on 
empowerment, efficiency in the delivery of services, and participation of the private sector and 
civil society. In terms of outreach, the saturation of basic necessities has been recognised as the 
first step to productive participation of every citizen in the economy, imperative for sustained 
medium-term growth. In terms of efficiency, the digitisation of healthcare, education and 
governance is a force multiplier for every rupee spent on a welfare programme. 
7.122  The education sector is bustling with the across-the-board transformation led by the 
NEP 2020, which is expected to yield Foundational Literacy And Numeracy for every child 
passing the third standard in the near future. That said, improving learning outcomes and 
undoing the COVID-induced learning loss is more urgent than ever. In healthcare, Ayushman 
Bharat is not only saving lives but also saving generations from the trap of debt. The challenge 
of ensuring mental health and well-being is intrinsically and economically valuable. In the age 
of social media and ‘the great rewiring of childhood’, this challenge must be met together with 
destigmatisation, community participation, and fortification of specialised human resources.
7.123  Women-led development is emanating from their social, economic, and political 
empowerment, occurring through a constructive intermingling of policy and social change. 
Nevertheless, much scope remains to enhance asset ownership among women, with significant 
intrinsic and instrumental gains of fairness and economy to be secured. 
7.124  Better quality of life in the hinterland is being reinforced by a host of enabling programmes. 
The self-help movement has come far in terms of its outreach, and the social capital stands to 
gain from professional assistance in marketing and management. To provide a fillip to rural 
enterprises, RSETI can be utilised as district hubs of skill development and enterprise. 
7.125  Further, a scheme, however well-designed and noble in its formulation, is only as good as 
its implementation. It is the governance and unity of purpose at all levels of Government which 
is the keystone to the success of a social programme. To maximise this efficiency of translating 
spending into outcomes, many channels at the ground level will have to be unclogged. 
7.126  At the heart of economic development lies human development, which is both the means 
and ends of the former. Unswerving in its commitment, India has a lot to be content about and 
a lot to be impatient for.

EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL 
DEVELOPMENT: TOWARDS 
QUALITY
Indian labour market indicators have improved in the last six years, as per the Periodic 
Labour Force Survey data, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.2 per cent in 
2022-23. Rising youth and female participation in the workforce present an opportunity 
to tap the demographic and gender dividend. The factory employment data exhibits 
the bounce-back of the organised manufacturing sector in FY22, with continued rise 
in employment and the upscaling of factories. The net payroll additions under EPFO 
have more than doubled in the past five years, signalling healthy growth in formal 
employment. With artificial intelligence taking roots in several spheres of economic 
activity, job market must adapt while steering the technological choices towards 
collective welfare is key. To generate and sustain quality employment, agro-processing 
and care economy are two promising candidates, the latter also being a necessity for 
levelling the playing field for women in labour market. The fillip to skilling has yielded 
progress while there remains scope for more, as only 4.4 per cent of young workforce is 
formally skilled. Many regulatory clean-ups pose as low-hanging fruits of employment 
generation, including multiple state-level laws relating to use of land, sectors restricted 
for women workers, and apprenticeship promotion.
INTRODUCTION
8.1	
Employment is the crucial link between growth and prosperity, and its quantity and 
quality determine the extent to which economic output translates into better quality of life for 
the population. To foster employment is to oil the engine of demand-led growth, kept running 
by a populace progressively less dependent on the Government for its dignified survival 
and sustenance. Generation of suitable employment opportunities, commensurate with the 
legitimate aspirations of India’s youth, is also necessary to reap the country’s once-in-a-lifetime 
demographic dividend.
8.2	 This chapter explores various aspects of employment and skill development in the country. 
The first section dwells on the employment situation in the country, specifically focussing on 
women and youth employment. The structural transformation of the workforce and the trend 

Economic Survey 2023-24
272
in factory employment are discussed, besides additions to EPFO’s payroll and trend in rural 
wages. It also presents a bird’s eye view of the government programmes to facilitate employment 
generation and promote labour welfare. The second section looks at the new forces shaping 
the labour market, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), gig work, climate change, etc. this is 
followed by an in-house simple estimation of the annual rise in job creation required to cater to 
the expanding working age population, rising female participation in labour force, and labour 
shifting out of agriculture. Next, agro-processing sector is proposed as a fertile sector for job 
creation in a pragmatic and decentralised manner. The next section discusses the felt need of a 
well-developed care economy, key to supporting workforce participation by women, and cater 
to an ageing population. The final section presents details of the country’s skilling infrastructure 
and the outcomes of policies in enhancing skilling for employability. 
CURRENT EMPLOYMENT SCENARIO
8.3	 Over the past decade, India has witnessed a notable transformation in its employment 
landscape, marked by several positive trends contributing to economic growth and social 
development. This evolution is a result of various factors, including economic reforms, 
technological advancements, and an emphasis on skill development. The slew of structural 
reforms promoting ease of doing business, undertaken in the last decade and ongoing, remain 
crucial for productive employment generation in the current decade.
8.4	 According to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) by the National Statistical 
Organisation, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), the all-India 
annual unemployment rate (UR)1 (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status2) has 
been witnessing a declining trend since the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been accompanied 
by a rise in the labour force participation rate (LFPR)3 and worker-to-population ratio (WPR)4. 
Even by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status (CWS)5, employment has 
recovered from the pandemic in urban and rural areas. 
8.5	
The quarterly PLFS reports for urban areas enable a more updated picture of employment. 
The quarterly urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined to 6.7 per 
cent in the quarter ending March 2024 from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the 
previous year, accompanied by a rise in the WPR and LFPR (Chart VIII.2).
1  UR is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.
2  For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic 
activity for at least 30 days during the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.
3  According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible 
efforts to seek ‘work’ or being available for ‘work’ if it is available. ‘Work’ includes self-employment (subsistence 
agriculture and collection of firewood, poultry farming, etc., for self-consumption), regular wage/salaried 
employment, and casual labour.
4  WPR is defined as the percentage of employed persons in the total population.
5  In the case of CWS, the activity status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding 
the date of the survey

8.6	 India’s workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 crore in 2022-23 using WPR from PLFS and 
MoHFW's population projections. According to PLFS, more than 45 per cent of the workforce 
is employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, and 13.0 
per cent is in construction. The predominance of agriculture in the providing employment to 
nearly half of the population, especially females, is both a challenge and an opportunity, as 
explained in the section on agro-processing in this chapter.

8.7	
In terms of employment status of workers, 57.3 per cent of the total workforce is self-
employed, and 18.3 per cent is working as unpaid workers in household enterprises. Casual 
labour comprises 21.8 per cent of the total workforce and regular wage/salaried workers are 
20.9 per cent of the total workforce. Gender-wise, it is the female workforce, which is shifting to 
self-employment, while the male workforce’s share has been stable. This is evident in the sharp 
rise in female LFPR in the past six years (discussed in later in this chapter), driven by rural 
women joining agriculture and related activities.

YOUTH AND FEMALE EMPLOYMENT 
Rising youth employment 
8.8	 India’s demographic dividend is a stepping stone for sustained high growth and global 
competitiveness in manufacturing and services. The decline in the annual youth unemployment 
rate accompanied by greater youth participation in the labour force indicates better utilisation 
of this dynamic resource. 
8.9	 According to PLFS, youth (age 15-29 years) unemployment rate has declined from 17.8 
per cent in 2017-18 to 10 per cent in 2022-23, while other indicators have also improved over 
time. The rise in youth employment is also reflected in the formal employment figures, as 
per Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data, presented in latter section of the 
chapter. The annual new EPF subscribers aged 18-28 years have been following an upward 
trajectory after witnessing a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly two-thirds of 
the new subscribers in the EPFO payroll have been from the 18-28 years band. Thus, youth 
employment has been rising in tandem with the youth population.

Rise in Female LFPR: Unfolding the gender dividend 
8.10	 From the gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has 
been rising for six years. While urban FLFPR has also been growing, the rural FLFPR has 
witnessed a steep rise of 16.9 percentage points between 2017-18 and 2022-23, indicating a 
rising contribution of women to rural production. This could culminate from multiple factors, 

Employment and Skill Development
277
including continuous high growth in agriculture output and freeing up of women’s time due to 
substantial expansion of access to basic amenities such as piped drinking water, clean cooking 
fuel, sanitation, etc. On the other hand, the possibility of the rise in FLFPR stemming from 
distress does not hold much ground since distress-driven FLFPR should have peaked during 
COVID-19 and declined afterwards instead of continuously rising since 2017-18. Other reasons 
that repudiate the thesis of distress-driven rise in FLFPR were elaborated in ‘Indian Economy 
- A Review’, published by DEA, Ministry of Finance in January 2024.6

Employment in Factories
8.11	 The Annual Survey of Industries7 (ASI) results for 2020-21 and 2021-22 showcased 
the Indian manufacturing sector’s resilience, given its turnaround after a marginal fall in 
employment in the pandemic year of 2020-21. As per ASI 2021-22, employment in the organised 
manufacturing sector recovered to above the pre-pandemic level, with the employment per 
factory continuing its pre-pandemic rise. The growth in wages per worker resumed after a brief 
hiatus. This, coupled with higher wage growth in the rural areas during the last five years, 
bodes well for demand creation in the countryside.8 During FY15-FY22, the wages per worker 
in rural areas grew at 6.9 per cent CAGR vis-à-vis a corresponding 6.1 per cent CAGR in urban 
areas.
6  The publication is available at https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Monthly%20Economic%20Review%20
January%202024.pdf 
7  The ASI, conducted by the MoSPI, covers the organised manufacturing sector of the economy. Its coverage extends 
to the entire Factory Sector comprising industrial units (called factories) registered under the Sections 2(m)(i) and 
2(m)(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, with ten or more workers with electricity or twenty or more workers without 
electricity. 
8  It may be noted that, as of FY22, 42 per cent of factories and 45 per cent of workers are in rural areas.

in larger factories. Compared to a broadly constant number of smaller factories, the number of 
factories employing more than 100 workers saw 11.8 per cent growth over FY18 to FY22. Thus, 
in terms of total persons engaged, employment has been rising in bigger factories (employing 
more than 100 workers) than in smaller ones, suggesting a scaling up of manufacturing units. 
This is a positive development in terms of quality of employment, as wages per worker tend to 
rise with the employment size of factories.

products industry (11.1 per cent) remained the largest employer, followed by textiles, primary 
metals, wearing apparel and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers. However, in terms of 
growth in employment in the last five years, the rising heft of computers and electronics, rubber 
and plastic products, and chemicals indicates that Indian manufacturing is moving up the value 
chain and have emerged as sunrise sectors for manufacturing employment generation.

FY19 to 131.5 lakh in FY24, swiftly recovering from the pandemic aided by the Aatmanirbhar 
Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY). The EPFO membership numbers (for which older data is

Government initiatives to boost employment generation
8.16	 The Government has implemented a series of measures to boost employment generation, 
such as the rollout of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to enhance India’s 
manufacturing capabilities, increase in capital expenditure, etc., and to promote worker 
welfare. This has been accompanied by a boost to self-employment through easing of access to 
credit, and multiple process reforms. Some of the schemes to promote both job creation and job 
creators are summarised in the Box VIII.1.
Box VIII.1: Initiatives to foster job creation and workers’ welfare
● 
Launched in 2015, the National Career Service (NCS) Portal offers employment 
and career services. By 31 March 2024, it has attracted 4.1 crore jobseekers and 25.6

Start Up India: Sustained eﬀorts by the Government spanning “simpliﬁcation and

and in cubation” have led to an increase in the number of Department for Promotion 
of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) recognised startups from over 300 in 2016 to 
1,17,254, as on 31 December 2023.16 These recognised startups are reported to have 
created over 12.42 lakh direct jobs creating signiﬁcant economic impact.17

Flagship programmes: Besides these initiatives, various flagship programmes of the 
Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for 
Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure Development 
and Industrial Corridors are also oriented towards generating employment opportunities.
8.17	 Besides active interventions for social protection of workers, the Government has also 
promoted simplification of labour laws, as recommended by the National Commission on 
Labour in 2002. The Government rationalised and amalgamated 29 central laws into four 
Labour Codes in 2019 and 2020, after extensive consultations with stakeholders and public 
from 2015 to 2019. This was to promote employment creation and freeing workers from the 
web of legislations many of which trace their origins to the pre-independence period, reduce 
multiplicity of definitions and authorities relating to labour, and to induce transparency, 
accountability, and use of technology in enforcement of labour laws. Thereafter, the four 
Labour Codes; namely, the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the 
Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions 
Code, 2020; have been enacted. The Code on Wages, 2019 was notified on 8 August, 2019 and 
the remaining three Codes were notified on 29 September, 2020.

8.18 “Labour” as a subject is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India and under 
the Codes, the power to make Rules has been entrusted to Central Government, appropriate 
Government and State Governments. There is also a requirement of pre-publication of Rules by 
states in their respective Official Gazette for public consultation. As per available information, 
32, 30, 31 and 31 States & UTs have also pre-published their draft Rules under the Code on 
Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020 and the 
Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 respectively.
8.19	 However, there remains scope to expedite the enactment of Labour Codes by the states. 
In addition, there exist other regulatory hurdles to employment generation, some of which are 
stricter than advanced economies, as elaborated in the Box VIII.2 
Box VIII.2: Re-balancing Labour Regulations to promote employment
Current labour regulations have unintended adverse repercussions for both the general 
workforce and women specifically. Although designed to safeguard women and enforce 
rigorous standards for all employees, these regulations inadvertently restrict employment 
opportunities and impede overall job creation. Some examples of these rules are mentioned 
below:
Higher overtime wage premium compared to peers and advanced economies
A comparison with other countries reveals that India’s stricter overtime wage regulations 
are potentially hindering the growth of the manufacturing sector by driving production to 
nations with lower overtime costs (Dandekar and Roy, 2023).18

Welfare demand discourages growth 
India prescribes higher floor space per worker on a factory floor compared to other countries. 
An Indian factory with 1,000 square metres (sqm) of usable floor space canemploy up to 82 
more workers if India were to adopt Malaysia’s standard.20 Increases in space requirements 
can discourage the expansion of factories.

Inflexibility in working hours
Many countries offer more flexibility in organising work hours and allow for more overtime 
compared to India. This is limiting the monetisable time for Indian workers and affecting 
their families and the country’s prosperity (Roy, Saxena, and Singh, 2023).21

Conclusion
The new Labour Codes marginally improve some of the observations above. In some cases, 
limits have been moved from the Law to Rules to be made by states. However, the Codes 
are yet to be fully operationalised and many states are found to be reintroducing the older 
restrictions under the new Laws.
Labour Laws need to be reviewed to re-evaluate incentives for employers, with a focus on 
achieving better outcomes for economic growth and prosperity in the manufacturing sector. 
Implementing more flexible labour laws could unleash substantial economic potential, 
promote gender inclusivity, and attract industrial investment.
8.20	 The states would also do well to reduce the compliance burden of the Micro, Small and 
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The management bandwidth in MSMEs to grow business, 
seek new markets, get funding, and hire labour is limited, and this limited bandwidth is spent 
disproportionately on compliance. Whereas the Union Government frames the Rules, the 
implementation or supervision is in the hands of Inspectors and Supervisors who come from 
the relevant departments in the states. This is where senior levels of bureaucracies at the Centre 
and states can and should collaborate to make it easier for businesses to comply without being 
squeezed out of time and other resources.
Trend in rural wages
8.21	 In FY24, rural wages rose at above-5 per cent every month, YoY. On an average, nominal 
wage rates in agriculture grew by 7.4 per cent for men and 7.7 per cent for women, benefitting 
from robust agriculture growth during the period. The wage growth in non-agricultural 

Employment and Skill Development
289
activities was relatively lower, at 6.0 per cent for men and 7.4 per cent for women during the 
same period. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing of international 
commodity prices and domestic food prices, it is expected to translate into a sustained rise in 
real wages.

THE EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF JOBS IN INDIA
8.22	 The interaction of various production factors in generating value-addition is constantly 
evolving in an economy that is in transition to middle-income status. The human resources who 
bring about this progression must also adapt to it to be employable in the changed scenario. The 
global labour market is amid a ‘disruption,’ constantly being reshaped by the fourth industrial 
revolution, concerted efforts by all economies to decarbonise in the wake of a looming climate 
crisis and other geopolitical vicissitudes. In a recent study, David Autor22 wrote that changes in 
the nature of work in the last few decades—primarily technological—have been more disruptive 
and less beneficial for non-college workers.
8.23	 According to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Future of Jobs report, 202323, in the 
next five years, 23 per cent of the jobs are expected to change globally. This change is likely to 
consist of growth in 10.2 per cent of the jobs and decline in 12.3 per cent of the jobs. Employers 
anticipate 69 million new jobs to be created and 83 million eliminated - a net decrease of 14 
million jobs, or 2 per cent of current employment. The following are some ways in which the 
work environment is evolving.
Fourth industrial revolution
8.24	 Epochal changes in the economic structures manifested by three Industrial Revolutions 
(IR), starting from the 18th century, have caused technological disruption and significant job 
displacement. Each has resulted in transformations in the manner in which firms and individuals 
interact with the labour markets, redefining the relationship between technology and how work 
gets done.24 Each IR caused a significant loss of livelihood for workers whose tasks were most 
susceptible to automation and those who could not quickly adapt to new technology. People 
have had to skill and reskill to maintain their place in the labour markets. 
8.25	 The world is in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution characterised by novel ways 
in which technology is becoming embedded within societies through ‘cyber-physical systems,’ 
Internet of Things (IoT), big data, nano-technology, and networks. Evolving forms of machine 
learning, AI, blockchains, genetic engineering, quantum computing, advanced analytics, 
automation, and advanced manufacturing technology are some examples of what constitutes 
this technological revolution. In the backdrop of this evolving revolution, the future of job 
markets in India is undergoing a significant transformation, as is happening in the rest of the 
world.
8.26	 The demand for digital roles is proliferating, hastened further by the COVID-19 pandemic 
and its lingering impact. Technological advancements are leading to a growing demand for 
tech-savvy professionals trained in emerging areas such as big data, AI and machine learning, 
cybersecurity, cloud computing, etc. According to the WEF, the fastest-growing jobs in the 
next five years will be those of AI and machine learning specialists, sustainability specialists,

business intelligence analysts and information security specialists; the largest absolute growth 
is expected in education, agriculture, and digital commerce.
Disruptions due to the adoption of AI
8.27	 The biggest disruption for the future of work is the accelerated growth in AI, which 
is poised to revolutionise the global economy. India would not remain immune to this 
transformation. AI is being recognised as a general-purpose technology, like electricity and 
the internet, which is phenomenal in its rapid pace of innovation and ease of diffusion. As AI 
systems continue to get smarter and adoption increases, the future of work will be reshaped. 
While AI has considerable potential for boosting productivity, it also has the potential to disrupt 
employment in certain sectors. Routine tasks, including customer service, will likely witness a 
high degree of automation; creative sectors will see extensive usage of AI tools for image and 
video creation; personalised AI tutors can reshape education and sectors like healthcare can 
witness accelerated drug discovery. On the impact of AI on employment, insights can be drawn 
from Acemoglu and Johnson’s work, presented in Box VIII.3.
Box VIII.3: Ricardo’s Pivot and the Centrality of Technological Choices
Conventional economic wisdom would suggest that technological changes generate 
productivity25 gains leading to higher wages and more economic opportunities in the long 
run. However, according to Acemoglu and Johnson (2024)26, “… taking such a long view 
ignores the struggles of workers to secure their fair share of prosperity made possible 
by the new machinery.” The authors take a cue from Industrial Revolution in Britain to 
understand the relationship between AI-induced rise in productivity and employment in the 
present. Specifically, the authors take the examples of automation of cotton spinning through 
the introduction of the spinning jenny in the late 18th century, automation of weaving by the 
power loom in the 19th century, and the advent of the railways and heavy industries in the 
second half of 19th century.

While spinning jennies reduced the cost of yarn and increased the productivity and demand 
of handloom weavers, the power loom led to labour substitution and halving of real wage 
of artisans between 1806 and 1820. The decline in real wages of weavers after the arrival of 
power loom is said to be behind Ricardo’s change in opinion from “machinery did not lessen 
the demand for labour” in 1819 to “If machinery could do all the work that labour now 
does, there would be no demand for labour” in 1821. Likewise, the coming of the Liverpool 
and Manchester railways in 1830 spurred new jobs in modern manufacturing, including 
design, repair, maintenance, and clerical tasks.
The authors highlight the inadequacy of economic factors to explain the impact of automation 
on wages and emphasise on the forces of political economy, i.e., the balance of power between 
labour and capital. Here, the interpretation of E.P. Thompson, an English historian, seems 
more suitable to them in explaining the impact of power loom on weavers. According to 
Thompson, the movement of workers to factories led to their loss of autonomy, and, in the 
absence of any policy support or bargaining power, culminated in the deterioration of wages 
and worker conditions.
In simple words, it is how we use the technology- whether we use it for automation, 
surveillance and control or we use it for informed decision making, problem-solving and 
augmentation29, that decides whether AI will facilitate the path of job creation or will be a 
hindrance to it. During Ricardo’s time, this choice was made by the factory owners, employers 
and industrialists while labourers underwent harsh working conditions, surveillance and 
control. Times have changed now, workers are certainly more independent, and hold power 
through strict labour laws and trade unions. Several reports today mention that AI will not 
destroy jobs rather transform them. Studies emphasise the need for humans to guide this AI 
transition.30 31 
The paper concludes that automation may be good or bad, depending on how we deploy it, 
and the direction of the technology being implemented. New technology can hurt labour 
interests by reducing the marginal productivity of labour32 while overall productivity may 
rise, thereby leading to substitution of labour by machines, as in the case of the handloom 
weavers. At the same time, automation can benefit labour in two ways. Firstly, if it significantly 
increases the marginal productivity of labour in the right sectors thereby increasing labour 
demand in non-automated tasks or in industries producing complementary products, as 
in the case of jennies. Secondly, when automation is accompanied by creation of new tasks 
and increase in marginal productivity of labour in new activities like in the railways example 
(Acemoglu and Johnson 2023). That said, political economy remains decisive in ensuring 
shared prosperity from technology. This is termed as the ‘centrality of technological  
choices’.

8.28	 Research done in the context of the US informs that Generative AI (GenAI) may have 
a far higher impact on reshaping jobs than replacing jobs.33 According to IMF (2023)34 and 
IMF (2024)35, almost 40 per cent of global employment is exposed to AI, with the exposure of 
advanced economies being 60 per cent due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. 
The study develops an index of potential AI complementarity, which suggests that about half of 
these may be negatively affected by AI. At the same time, the rest could benefit from enhanced 
productivity through AI integration. It finds that employment highly exposed to AI is 26 per 
cent for India, divided into 14 per cent for occupations with high complementarity and 12 per 
cent for those with low complementarity.36 37
8.29	 India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated 
as AI poses both risk and opportunity. According to Capital Economics (2024), the current 
diffusion and adaptation of AI in India remains low compared to US, Europe, and the developed 
Asian economies. Manufacturing sector is less exposed to AI as industrial robots are neither as 
nimble nor as cost-effective as human labour. In inventory and supply chain management, 
AI applications could rather be complementary to labour. Nevertheless, at particular risk is 
the BPO sector, where GenAI is revolutionising the performance of routine cognitive tasks 
through chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the 
next ten years. In the following decade, however, gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment 
productivity. Uses of AI to identify health risks out of digitalised health data, predict weather, 
and complementing teachers in grading tests and translating texts are some of the development 
gaps that AI can plug.38
8.30	 Widespread adoption of AI across the services sector can significantly reshape and even 
replace jobs. Based on job postings data from India’s largest job website, Copestake, A. et. al. 
(2023) interpret a near-exponential increase in the demand for AI-related skills since 2016. 
They find that the demand for AI skills by businesses has a negative impact on the need for non-
AI roles and on the top percentile of wages, due to the displacement of high-skilled, managerial 
positions and non-routine, intellectual tasks.39
8.31	 Given the affinity of India’s population to work with technology, as seen with the digital 
public infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position 
India as a key player in the AI age. Employees or job seekers would need skills beyond 
communication, collaboration, and presentation, such as analytical thinking and innovation;

and programming; and resilience and adaptability, to face the AI challenge
Making the most of AI in India
8.32	 Despite India being one of the leaders in AI globally, a review of existing literature shows 
that not much prior research has been done in India. This gap highlights the need for research 
and development in this sector. The AI related research papers published by China in 2019 
were 102,161, followed by 74,386 in US and 23,398 in India, which is less than one-fourth of 
China. Outputs in AI Research and Development are highly skewed, with concentration in only 
a few countries.40 41
8.33	 The US, being the leader in the AI R&D output, has clearly laid out a well-defined strategic 
plan to strengthen its AI sector. The plan consists of 9 steps, as mentioned in the latest 2023 
report by its National Science and Technology Council42, i.e., making long-term investments 
in AI Research, developing effective methods for human-AI collaboration, understanding 
and addressing implications of AI , ensuring the safety and security of AI systems, developing 
datasets for AI training and testing, measuring and evaluating AI systems, better understand 
national AI R&D workforce needs, expanding private-public partnerships, and establishing 
a coordinated approach to international collaboration in AI Research. This strategy marks a 
significant move of the US Government to address the challenges that cannot be resolved by the 
sectors alone.
8.34	 A policy brief by Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) 
suggested that there is a need for an Inter-Agency Coordination Authority for AI which would 
act as a central institution guiding the research, decision-making, policy planning on AI and 
job creation.43 The brief also suggested that AI will create more jobs but may have a negative 
short-term impact, and to counter this impact there is a need to invest in capacity building, 
upskilling, training, and forming policies to ensure that low-skilled workers do not suffer from 
any potential job losses.
8.35	 AI has made a significant growth in the agri-tech, industry & automotive, healthcare, 
BFSI and retail sectors in India. One of the significant examples include Praman Exchange, 
world’s largest horticulture exchange, powered by Intello Labs which uses computer vision to 
map the quality of horticulture products. Pramaan’s technology achieves quality assessment 
with 95 per cent accuracy, surpassing the manual assessment rate of 70 per cent. This gives the 
contractors the required time and flexibility to trade from anywhere in the world.44

8.36	 The Government has launched several initiatives to ensure an AI enabled ecosystem and 
to connect AI to the youth of the country. Some of these include ‘Future Skills Prime’, ‘YUVAi: 
Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI’ a national programme for school students and ‘Responsible 
AI for Youth 2022’45. A budget of ₹10,300 crore has been provided in 2024 for the India AI 
Mission, a significant move to strengthen the AI ecosystem.46
Shift towards gig economy
8.37	 A marked shift in the employment scenario has led to the rise of the gig economy 
globally. It encompasses freelancers, online platform workers, self-employed, on-call 
workers, and creative tech talent. In India, the rise of the gig economy is driven by the 
emergence of tech-enabled platforms, an increase in access to the internet backed by the 
development of digital public infrastructure, the demand for flexible work arrangements, 
and the focus on skills. According to NITI Aayog’s indicative estimates based on national 
labour force survey data, in 2020–21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig 
economy. They constituted 2.6 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 1.5 per cent of 
the total workforce in India.47
8.38	 Research studies have shown that participation in the gig economy is higher in developing 
countries (between five and 12 per cent) compared to developed economies (between one 
and four per cent), and most of these jobs are in lower-income job types, such as deliveries, 
ridesharing, microtasks, care and wellness (BCG 2021).48 The continuing high demand for 
such services and job flexibility is boosting entry-level job creation in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, 
including part-time work for students entering the job market or as a shock absorber in case 
of temporary unemployment, with a high probability of workers moving to better-paying jobs 
after the platform experience (NCAER 2023).49 
8.39	 The gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) by 2029–30. Gig 
workers are expected to form 6.7 per cent per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1 
per cent of the total livelihood in India by 2029–30.50 While the gig economy may open up 
employment opportunities for various sections of workers, including youth, persons with 
disabilities, and women, a significant issue in the Indian context and globally has been the 
creation of effective social security initiatives for gig and platform workers. The Code on Social 
Security (2020) marks a significant advancement by expanding the scope of social security 
benefits to encompass gig and platform workers. 
Climate change and green energy transition
8.40	 With climate change a hard reality of the present times and projections pointing towards 
an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the concomitant outcome 
is the possible loss of jobs and productivity. Heat is an occupational safety and health hazard.

temperature rise of 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century and also on labour force trends suggest 
that in 2030,3.8 per cent of total working hours worldwide will be lost to high temperatures 
– the equivalent of 136 million full-time jobs– and economic losses of $2,400 billion.51 The 
Report notes that India is one of the most vulnerable countries to productivity losses, given 
its high share of agricultural and construction employment and location within the tropical 
latitude.
8.41	 Another aspect of climate change is the efforts to mitigate its impact by adopting green 
technologies and transitioning to greener energy alternatives. This trend is leading to businesses 
witnessing a strong job-creation effect driven by investments that facilitate the green transition 
of businesses and the application of ESG standards. 
8.42	 For instance, India’s green transition is and is more likely to significantly impact job 
opportunities in the renewable energy sector. Tyagi et al (2021)52 observes that, by 2030, 
clean energy initiatives can potentially create about 3.4 million jobs (short and long-term) by 
installing 238 GW of solar and 101 GW of new wind capacity to achieve the 500 GW non-fossil 
electricity generation capacity. These jobs represent those created in the wind and on-grid solar 
energy sectors. About one million can be employed to take up these green jobs.53 
8.43	 Climate change also affects worker well-being, as highlighted in a recent ILO report54, 
creating a ‘cocktail’ of health hazards for 70 per cent of the world’s workforce. Workers, 
especially those in manual jobs, thus need suitably designed policy support and private 
insurance products to protect their health and incomes from the vagaries of heatwaves, floods, 
cyclones, etc. Here, an innovative pilot programme by Self Employed Women’s Association 
(SEWA) is noteworthy. Launched in 2023, a heat-linked parametric insurance covering 22,000 
unorganised workers entails partial wage payment when temperature breaches 43.60 C with 
the premium borne partially by the worker and rest through charity. By helping the workers 
to cover food and medication requirement, the payout provides a shield against the scorching 
heat. Ultimately, SEWA plans to sign up 29 lakh members which would allow the premiums to 
be fully funded by the workers themselves.55
8.44	 To sum up, as the country navigates the complexities of the future job market alongside 
the global trends, as discussed above, acceptance and adapting to change and encouraging 
innovation will be the key to harnessing the opportunities and dealing with the challenges 
presented before us. Dwelling deeper into these trends in the job markets and finding cost-
effective solutions through careful planning and implementation would go a long way in 
mitigating the negative impacts on the job’s ecosystem.

REQUIREMENT OF JOB CREATION UNTIL 2036
8.45	 This section attempts a broad estimation of the requirement for job creation in the non-
farm sector, using a simple model and some assumptions. The current workforce in 2022-2356 
has been estimated using the WPR (usual status, all ages) for 2022-23 from PLFS and the 
corresponding population estimates by MoHFW.57 The rise in workforce has been estimated 
assuming constant WPR for men (54.4 per cent in 2023) and rising WPR for women (from 
27.0 per cent in 2023 to 40.0 per cent in 2036, increasing by 1 percentage point every year).58 
Further, to account for the structural transformation, it is assumed that the share of agriculture 
in workforce gradually declines from 45.8 per cent in 202359 to one-fourth in 2047,60 and the 
corresponding workforce thereby leaving agriculture is added to the rise in workforce. This is a 
reasonable assumption to make given the sticky predominance of agriculture in employment, 
and the potential of high-value agriculture and allied activities to generate remunerative 
employment, especially for women. Consequently, Indian economy needs to generate an 
average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising 
workforce (see Chart VIII.24 below).

8.46	 To meet the demand of 78.5 lakh jobs in non-farm sector per year, there is scope to 
supplement the existing schemes of PLI (60 lakh employment generation over 5 years),61 
MITRA Textile scheme (20 lakh employment generation),62 MUDRA, etc., while boosting 
their implementation. In the following sections, two sectors for further job creation have been 
identified and elaborated upon. Over and above the quantity of employment, its quality and 
social security aspect has its own significance. The rising employment of flexi workers through 
staffing companies can be a channel for ensuring social security for informal workers, as briefed 
in Box VIII.4.
Box VIII.4: Flexi job market in India
There are nearly 5.4 million formal contract staff or flexi workers in India employed through 
organised contract/temporary staffing companies. These staffing companies are responsible 
for the timely payout of salaries/wages, social security/medical insurance towards their 
contract staff. Although they work on a contract, these workers are fully protected with social 
security, and the average length of contract has been rising with more than 75 per cent of the 
contracts in 2023 for over six months. The flexi workforce has grown at a CAGR of 13.2 per 
cent in the decade ending 2023, and remained positive even during the COVID pandemic. 
However, as a share of the total workforce, the contract staffing workforce is about 1 per 
cent only, compared to 2.2 per cent in Europe and Asia Pacific. The low percentage of flexi 
jobs in India indicates that the corporate sector has not replaced full-time workers with flexi 
workers.

skill spectrum such as data operations, accounts, sales, back-end operations, administration

AGRO-PROCESSING AS A PROMISING SECTOR FOR RURAL 
EMPLOYMENT AND GROWTH
8.47	 The agro-processing sector lies at the intersection of multiple opportunities for rural 
growth besides being an intermediate sector for the ‘farm to factory’ transition. The following 
paras elaborate on the suitability of agro-processing for job creation, given India’s stage of 
development.
8.48	 Demand for rural jobs: MGNREGS data shows substantial demand for low-skill rural 
jobs (especially by women, who constitute more than half of MGNREGS workforce), and there 
remains ample scope for shifting MGNREGS labour to more productive and less fiscally-
straining ventures. Given that agriculture and related industries remain the mainstay of 
the rural economy, increasing productivity in this sector is imperative to create jobs. Agro-
processing can also accelerate crop diversification in areas such as Punjab and Haryana, where 
paddy cultivation faces serious challenges related to groundwater scarcity.
8.49	 Low value-addition in agriculture: While India is endowed with 11.2 per cent of total 
arable land in the world and is ranked first in the production of milk, pulses, and jute, second 
in fruits and vegetables and third in cereals63,value addition in agriculture continues to be low. 
63  Annual Report, MoFPI, 2021-22

Economic Survey 2023-24
300
As per a study conducted on the Level of Food Processing in India (Deloitte, 2020-21)64, the 
processing level in India is at 4.5 per cent for fruits, 2.7 per cent for vegetables, 21.1 per cent 
for milk, 34.2 per cent for meat and 15.4 per cent for fishery. In contrast, 30 per cent of food in 
China is processed as against 60-80 per cent in Western countries (Liu et al. 2007).65 
8.50	 Rising demand for diverse and local food products: A better connection of farmers with 
food processing units could bring a more extensive and diverse pool of agricultural products 
to the market, the demand for which has been rising with affluence and diet-consciousness 
in India and abroad. As per a report by InvestIndia66, the Indian food processing market is 
estimated to reach USD535 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 15.2 per cent. Tier-2 and Tier-
3 cities could mirror the trend visible in metropolitan areas by consuming more processed food 
in the coming years. Further, the share of processed food exports in agri-exports has increased 
substantially from 13.7 per cent in FY15 to 25.6 per cent in FY23.
8.51	 Presence of precedents: There are many success stories to emulate a bottom-up approach 
to agro-processing, such as the Sahyadri Farmer Producer Company in Maharashtra (refer to 
Box VIII.5), Araku Coffee plantations by tribals in Andhra Pradesh, Mahagrapes in Maharashtra 
supported by Mahindra Agro, and Synthites spice-processing group in Kerala.
Box VIII.5: Sahyadri’s Success in Agro-processing
Sahyadri Farmer Producer Company (SFPC), an agro-processing unit based in Nashik, 
Maharashtra, has emerged as a beacon of agricultural innovation and socio-economic 
development in the region. Boasting more than 12 years of experience in the industry, 
Sahyadri crossed a remarkable turnover of ₹1000 crore in FY23.67. The impressive growth 
trajectory is attributed to a farmer-centric approach accompanied by a robust supply chain, 
efficient technology, and world-class infrastructure.
The exponential growth in Sahyadri Farms has led to the creation of 1300 full-time jobs 
and an additional 4000 seasonal jobs68, thus contributing to the region’s employment 
opportunities. With infrastructure spanning over 31,000 acres of land, SFPC holds the 
status of being India’s largest exporter of fresh grapes and processed fruits such as tomatoes, 
mangoes, sweet corn, and cashew nuts.
The heart of SPFC’s ethics lies in its unwavering support for small-scale farmers, with over 95 
per cent of associated farmers owning less than one hectare of land.69. This not only fosters 
sustainable agricultural practices but also fuels the rural economy by boosting income levels 
within local communities.

In a strategic move to strengthen the value chain for cashews, a vital crop in the region, 
SFPC has established Maharashtra’s largest cashew processing facility at its Mohadi campus 
in Nashik.70 This initiative represents a significant step in improving the value proposition 
of cashew production in the region. Additionally, Sahyadri has projected that this initiative 
will facilitate employment for over 300 women in the area, thereby contributing to the social 
and economic development of the region.71
8.52	 Avenues for captive demand of agro-processed output: The local units can supply the 
Aanganwadis, mid-day meal in schools, while agglomerations can supply urban consumers 
with rising health consciousness and ‘vocal for local’ sentiment. Specialised products could be 
linked to export supply chains, and a national portal listing all such products could be linked to 
e-commerce entities.
8.53	 Convergence of multiple existing programmes: The sector can benefit from utilising the 
synergies between Mega Food Park, Skill India, Mudra, one district-one product, etc., for labour, 
logistics, credit, and marketing. Such convergence of efforts would immensely benefit from a 
whole-of-government approach involving gram panchayat, block, and district administration. 
Organisations such as NABARD, Central Warehouse Corporation, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, etc., 
could be roped in for prompt handholding and troubleshooting, given their expertise and 
infrastructure in place. Women’s self-help groups could be the foot soldiers in devising and 
implementing block- or panchayat-level plans, given their credibility, good repayment record, 
and rising relevance to women in farming. 
8.54	 Thus, India, being an agriculturally gifted country, can utilise the range of products on 
offer by its different agro-climatic zones and productively engage the sizeable rural workforce, 
comprising women who seek remunerative part-time employment and educated youth who can 
be technically skilled to handle small to medium scale agro-processing units. 
CARING OUR WAY TO GROWTH: THE NECESSITY AND 
PROSPECTS OF A WELL-DEVELOPED CARE ECONOMY IN 
INDIA
8.55	 The care economy is hitherto less known yet potentially significant for economic growth 
and well-being, especially for a young country like India, which has both demographic and 
gender dividends to reap. The interconnected dynamics of bolstering a care economy holds the 
promise of gender equity, human development, and economic growth. Developing a quality 
and reliable care sector can thus fill a critical efficiency gap in facilitating the best allocation 
of human resources, driven by comparative advantage and choice rather than dictated by 
gender. This sub-section explores the contours of the long-term benefits of prioritising care 
and proposes a few solutions to further develop this sector.

Defining care work - the first step to acknowledging care as ‘work’
8.56	 According to the ILO, care work consists of activities and relations involved in meeting the 
physical, psychological, and emotional needs of adults and children, old and young, frail and 
able-bodied. Care work falls into two categories: compensated and unpaid/underpaid. Unpaid 
or underpaid work related to caregiving and providing social support is often performed within 
households by females and usually consists of childcare, eldercare, domestic work, etc. Paid 
care work involves labour performed by nurses, caregivers, etc., for remuneration. 
Increasing need for a well-developed care economy
Demographic transition – need to prepare for future care requirements of an 
ageing population
8.57	 India’s care needs are slated to expand significantly in the next 25 years, as an ageing 
population follows the ongoing demographic transition while the population of children stays 
relatively sizeable. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)72as of 2022, 
one-fourth of India’s population is aged 0-14 years (i.e., 36 crore persons), while one-tenth is 
above 60 years (i.e., 14.7 crore persons). By 2050, the share of children is estimated to decline 
to 18 per cent (i.e., 30 crore persons), while the proportion of elderly persons would rise to 20.8 
per cent (i.e., 34.7 crore persons). Thus, compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country 
would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050. The additional requirements for care would 
be further upscaled as more women participate in paid work, the rising prevalence of nuclear 
families73, etc.
Equal opportunity for females – decoupling gender and unpaid care work
8.58	 Developing an appropriate care economy is crucial when viewed through the lens of 
fairness and efficiency of increasing the FLFPR by affording equal opportunity to participate 
in paid work. This is especially important given the predominant burden of unpaid care work, 
including domestic work, childcare, and elderly care, falling on women, who are then too “time-
poor” to participate fully in employment opportunities. This is a global phenomenon, which 
holds for India as well. The disproportionate burden of care on women is consequential to the 
low FLFPR across the world, including India.74 According to Sinha et al. (2024), an additional 
hour of caregiving per day reduces women’s labour market participation by 20 percentage 
points, with no effect on men.75

8.59	 According to the NSO’s Time Use Statistics for 2019, working-age women in India spend 
5.6 hours per day on unpaid work, compared to only 30 minutes per day by men. Even women 
in paid employment spend nearly 6X time on unpaid care work compared to men in paid 
employment, culminating in the ‘double burden’ of performing both paid work and unpaid care 
responsibilities. This care burden-induced professional inequality is in contrast with the rising 
equality of opportunity in education, with the closing of the gender gap in higher education 
enrolment in India.
8.60	 Specifically, the impact of childbearing and childcare is found to have a significant cost 
on women’s careers, termed the ‘motherhood penalty’, depicted as a drop in FLFPR around 
childbearing years and a loss of income. Regarding the quality of employment, the motherhood 
penalty manifests in women tending to be concentrated in farming and informal jobs, as those 
workspaces are compatible with their personal care responsibilities (Palriwala and Neetha 
(2012)).76 Even though the time spent on unpaid care work per day is only 9 minutes higher for 
rural women vis-à-vis urban women, higher rural FLFPR could be explained by the flexibility, 
in terms of timing and proximity of employment, which allows child supervision, that rural jobs 
typically provide (Gautham 2022).77
Economic potential – generating value by making the best use of human capital 
8.61	 This unpaid/invisible domestic work performed by women, which is usually neglected 
while calculating the labour force and the GDP, has been variously estimated as highly valuable 
yet invisible. A recent report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) uses a standardised 
input-value method to estimate the economic value of women’s unpaid domestic and care work 
in India as 15 – 17 per cent of GDP.78 
8.62	 The economic value of developing a care sector is twofold – increasing FLFPR (discussed 
previously) and promoting a promising sector for output and job creation. According to ILO 
(2018), the care sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors globally, and investments in the 
care services sector are estimated to generate 475 million jobs globally by 2030. In the case of 
India, direct public investment equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP has the potential to generate 11 
million jobs, nearly 70 per cent of which will go to women.79 
Multidimensional impact of creches - Empirical evidence 
8.63	 A wide range of research has emphasised the impact of affordable and reliable childcare on 
freeing women’s time for paid employment, enhancing mental health and improving children’s 
learning and nutrition. That said, the literature is mainly foreign and empirical studies on India 
are scarce.

Chart VIII.27: Impact of lack of access to childcare: A conceptual model
Source: Nandi et al. (2020)
8.64	 For example, the availability of public childcare services in Mexico through supply-side 
and demand-side incentives—such as subsidies to low-income earning women and grants for 
childcare facilities—had a dual effect on the involvement of women in the labour force. First, 
low-income mothers received assistance in finding paid employment. Second, the initiative 
created some 45,000 paid positions for caregivers and their assistants - the majority of whom 
were women (OECD 2012)80.
8.65	 In Brazil, children aged 0–3 who live in low-income neighbourhoods could access 
integrated social, health, and educational services through the Rio de Janeiro Public Day Care 
programme. According to Barros et al. (2011), the programme had significant impact on female 
economic opportunities as mothers’ employment increased by 27 per cent, and a very high 
utilisation rate resulted from having access to the programme.81 While India-specific research 
on the impact of access to childcare is very limited, some of the studies that examined the 
situation in India are presented below.
8.66	 According to a qualitative study by Mobile Creches NGO in 4 states (Gujarat, Jharkhand, 
Odisha, Karnataka)82 carried out in December 2021- February 2022, 61 per cent of employed 
women availing creches relied on NGOs, while the share of government-run creches was 
relatively small (21 per cent). The employed women not availing creches relied mainly on adult 
family members (41 per cent) and elder daughters (11 per cent). The study found a positive 
impact of quality creche facilities on women’s well-being, income, child well-being, and 
relationships with family members.

8.67	 A study on SEWA childcare centres83 revealed that beneficiary women could work more 
hours during the day and more days during the month, leading to higher incomes and savings.
8.68	 As per a recent Randomised Controlled Trial in Rajasthan of creches or Balwadis run 
by a local NGO, nearly half of the women offered day care used it. Creches helped reduce 
malnutrition, decrease stress, and increase the self-reported happiness of mothers (Nandi et 
al.)84
Government Programme: Revamped Palna scheme for creches
8.69	 The Anganwadi-Cum-Crèche initiative under the Palna Scheme of the Ministry of Women 
and Child Development underwent revisions and was included in the Mission Shakti in April 
2022. The scheme aims to address the gap that exists mainly in urban areas where support for 
childcare from family members is not available, and there is a need for institutional support to 
facilitate the contribution of women to the economy. The Government aims to establish 17,000 
Anganwadi-cum-Crèches under the scheme, of which 5222 have been approved as of December 
2023.85 The scheme can significantly benefit from broader coverage in rural and urban areas.
Senior care reforms in India: Reimagining the senior care paradigm

to the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) ‘Ageing Well in Asia’ report,86 The old-age dependency 
ratio is expected to rise from less than 20 per cent in 2022 to over 30 per cent by 2050. The 
care responsibility associated with an increasingly older population necessitates initiating early 
dialogues around senior care to develop a future-ready elderly care policy.
The rising need for elderly care 
8.71	 The India Ageing Report 202387 by UNFPA and the International Institute for Population 
Sciences highlights that a significant portion of the elderly population suffers from chronic 
diseases, functional limitations, depressive symptoms, and low life satisfaction. As the elderly 
population is increasingly female and residing in rural areas, feminisation and ruralisation of 
the elderly are linked with poverty, dependency, and loneliness. The recommendations of the 
report are as follows.

● 
Increasing awareness about existing schemes for older persons, bringing all Old Age Homes 
under regulatory purview, and encouraging the creation and running of elderly self-help 
groups.
● 
Emphasising the importance of elderly people living in multigenerational households. 
Encourage policies that facilitate and support this living arrangement.
● 
Encouraging in situ (at home) ageing as much as possible by creating short-term care 
facilities like creches or day-care facilities. 
Need for a wholesome policy for elderly care
8.72	 As per a recent position paper on senior care reforms by the NITI Aayog88, while the elderly 
care industry is presently estimated at USD 7 billion (₹57,881 crore), there remain critical 
gaps in infrastructure, research, and know-how for geriatric illness management, monitoring 
mechanisms and emergency response systems. India, therefore, needs a structured elderly care 
policy framework.
8.73	 According to the ADB report89, the working capacity of older people is a sizeable economic 
resource. Utilising this ‘silver dividend’ of untapped work capacity of population aged 60-69 
years is estimated to increase GDP by an average of 1.5 per cent for Asian economies. The 
report advocates for age-friendly jobs with a gradual work-to-retirement path encompassing 
lifelong learning and skill development. From the care perspective, suitable job roles for older 
population can offer social engagement, financial security, besides reducing the overall care 
requirement. Box VIII.6 presents some suggestions on building a care economy ecosystem in 
the country. 
Box VIII.6: Building a better care ecosystem
Strategic reforms are required to build a solid structure of the care economy. The reforms 
could be along the following lines: (i) support for parental leave policies; (ii) subsidies 
for care services; (iii) public and private investments in building care infrastructure; (iv) 
mechanisms for skill training for care workers; and (v) mechanisms for monitoring service 
quality and benchmarks; offers a comprehensive framework for addressing the gender 
disparities in care and domestic work and boosting women’s labour force participation. 
Some specific policy interventions could be:
● 
Sector Skill Council for Care Services can be set up to help develop a skill training 
framework for the care sector, formulate skilling modules, and undertake partnerships 
with international skill training institutes. There is a need for a dedicated Care Sector 
Skills Council.

● 
Public-private partnerships (PPP) could play a significant role in building the 
care infrastructure, especially institutions for childcare and the elderly. Policies may 
be formulated to invest in mobile creches in offices, hospitals, and other public areas, 
encouraging women to take up paid employment opportunities. 
●	
Care services provision, both publicly run or privately operated facilities, would require 
institutional oversight and continuous monitoring. This ensures that the 
infrastructure is well-maintained and care services are satisfactory. In some countries, 
there are formal regulatory mechanisms to maintain defined minimum standards of 
infrastructure and service provision in care facilities.90 
● 
Collaboration with community-based and civil society organisations (CSOs) 
can acquaint the system with ground-level reality and help address operational issues 
with the care infrastructure and financial constraints.
● 
Subsidising care services can be considered. The successful international models of 
Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and the USA in this sector may offer valuable insights for 
India. These countries provide financial assistance through vouchers and tax rebates to 
the care workers based on their income, child’s age, number of offspring, etc.
● 
Owing to the SHGs’ strong sense of entrepreneurship, the model of self-managed 
institutions, for example, Jeevika in Bihar, may be followed to provide a dedicated 
childcare services programme and a capacity-building programme for care workers.
● 
Generating awareness about creches to cater to informal workers’ latent demand for 
affordable childcare.
● 
Ground-level work with community groups and local decision-makers would bring 
contextualised management innovations for quality and sustainability. 
● 
Developing innovative business models – Start-up India can be leveraged to incentivise 
commercial and community-based models to pilot and scale up childcare support for 
women in the informal sector.
● 
A Rating system of creches and elderly homes – on the lines of OFSTED (Office for 
Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills) of the UK.
8.74	 The non-government sector has developed innovative solutions for the rising need for 
elderly care providers. Tata-funded start-up Goodfellows91 is a leading initiative attempting 
to tackle the challenge of loneliness, which has been termed as a serious health issue putting 
individuals at a greater risk of dementia and mental decline.92 This start-up hires young 
people called “grandpals” having emotional intelligence and empathy to interact with lonely 
senior citizens longing for companionship. It is also an excellent example of strengthening 
multigenerational communication and understanding, with mutual benefits.
90  For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills 
(OFSTED) inspects and regulates care services for children and young people. On similar lines, there is a need 
for institutional mechanisms in India for quality assurance of care service provision.

8.75	 Other inspiring examples in actualising care ecosystem include Vedanta’s comprehensive 
parenthood policy of 12 months sabbatical for new mothers and flexible working hours after 
maternity leave by Vedanta Ltd., and the provision of full-time childcare to 3639 children up to 
the age of six for children of informal women workers under the Sangini Model of the SEWA.93 
Internationally, Swedish Government recognition of ‘even distribution of unpaid housework 
and care work’ as a policy sub-target is inspiring. Closer home, Haryana’s recent crèche policy 
is notable for being the pioneer among Indian states, as per which working women can keep 
their child aged six months to six years in the crèche for eight to ten hours where skilled and 
trained personnel will be deployed.94 
8.76	 To sum up, the care economy is a top-tier entry in India’s to-do list for becoming a 
developed nation by 2047. Not only does the availability of care infrastructure and services 
reduce women’s time poverty and enhance FLFPR, but the provision of care infrastructure 
and services also acts as a standalone business opportunity, particularly suited for women-led 
entrepreneurship and women’s employment. The care sector thus offers a vast potential for 
India’s economic growth. While the attitudinal shift towards gender-neutral sharing of parental 
responsibilities would be gradual, policies can accentuate the shift. That requires creating a 
fair, efficient, and contextual ecosystem of affordable care services. The prevalence of small-
scale care models (such as Mobile Creches95) for more than half a century suggests that it is 
possible.
DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS IN SKILLING
8.77	 In order to reap the demographic advantage, it is necessary to equip our workforce with 
employable skills and knowledge that meet the requirements of the globalised labour market 
and Industry 4.0. Measures are being taken by Government to translate India’s demographic 
dividend into a productivity dividend by enabling job and entrepreneurial opportunities that 
are in sync with the aspirations and abilities of India’s youth. It is partnering with the industry 
to enhance skilling with employability (See Box VIII.7).
8.78	 Over the period 2017-18 to 2022-23, there is a significant improvement in the proportion 
of skilled people across all socio-economic classifications, including rural, urban and gender 
classification, as indicated in Chart VIII.28. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey 
(PLFS) report 2022-23, 4.4 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15-29 years have received 
formal vocational/technical training, while another 16.6 per cent received training through 
informal sources.

of acquiring skill” in India. The rise in the number of candidates undergoing skill development 
through the Government’s flagship programmes has underlined the thrust to ‘Skill India’, as 
highlighted in Table VIII.2. The across-the-board progress in skilling has manifested in India’s 
rising position in WorldSkills Competitions, held every two years.97

Box VIII.7: Partnering with industry for skilling
Industry connection is crucial to any large-scale skilling programme, enabling contemporary 
relevance and employability and ascertaining demand to absorb the newly skilled workforce. 
In cognisance of this, the Skill India mission actively collaborates with the industry through 
National Skill Development Council (NSDC)-driven partnerships for skill development, 
reskilling, and upskilling. Until March 2024 (starting date to be added), 131 projects have 
been undertaken by NSDC, with 62 corporate organisations benefitting over 3.10 lakh 
persons across the country, including 42 aspirational districts. 
Skill Impact Bond
Launched in 2021, the Skill Impact Bond leverages an innovative and results-based finance 
mechanism - Development Impact Bond99 model to attract private sector funds and expertise 
for skill development, job placements, and retention. This initiative by NSDC and its 
coalition partners100 targets training 50,000 youth, ensuring at least 60 per cent are female, 
through selected and monitored NSDC-affiliated training partners over four years. Between 
November 2021 and March 2024, 29,365 candidates have been enrolled over five cohorts, 
23,464 have been certified, 19,209 have been placed and 13,853 reported job retentions. The 
program has reported 74 per cent women enrolment so far.
Further, the Directorate General of Training (DGT) has also taken the following initiatives 
under Industry Partnerships:
●	
Under the Flexi MoU Scheme with prominent industry partners such as Maruti 
Suzuki India Limited, Gurugram, NMDC Chhattisgarh, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. 
Ltd, etc. - about 9600 trainees have been trained under this initiative from March 2019 
to March 2024.
● 
Under the Dual System of Training (DST) initiative, skilling institution trainees get 
first-hand workplace experience. During the 2022 session, about 978 ITIs and 37,865 
trainees were covered under DST. 
● 
DGT has collaborated with IT frontlines like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Adobe, 
Amazon Web services, etc., to enable trainees to become Industry Ready as per IR 4.0, 
and more than 21.5 lakh trainees have been trained under these collaborations between 
November 2019 and March 2024.
● 
Besides mandated training of Instructor trainees, NSTIs are also Skilling/Re-skilling/
Upskilling the existing industry workforce by partnering with ISRO, ONGC, 
Indian Railways, Naval Ship Repair yard, Naval Ship Dockyard, and BHEL. Under this 
initiative, about 1400 participants were trained during the FY24 session.
99  Impact bonds shift the focus from inputs to performance and results. Rather than a government or a donor 
financing a project upfront, private investors initially finance the initiative and are repaid by ‘outcome funders’, 
only if agreed-upon outcomes are achieved. This mechanism creates incentives for every partner to achieve 
learning outcomes and not just deliver services.
100  Partners comprise of the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), JSW Foundation, HSBC India, and 
Dubai Cares as outcome funders, the British Asian Trust as the transaction manager, USAID and FCDO (UK 
Government) as technical partners, Oxford Policy Manager as the independent evaluator, and NSDC and 
Dalberg Advisors as performance managers. NSDC and MSDF are the risk investors that have committed $4 
million to provide upfront working capital to the service providers.

● 
DGT is also collaborating with industry partners for infrastructure 
development/upgradation in NSTIs/ITIs. Notable collaborators include Dassault 
for Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter, Pidilite and Jaguar for the Plumbing 
sector, Skoda for the automobile industry, and HAL and Siemens for advanced CNC 
machinery training, among others.
8.81	 The PM Vishwakarma scheme to provide end-to-end support to artisans and craftspeople 
is a new scheme (briefed in Box VIII.8) to address various constraints of artisans to upgrade 
their enterprise, thus infusing the traditional vocations with dynamism. 
Box VIII.8: PM Vishwakarma Scheme: Making progress
The PM Vishwakarma programme was launched in September 2023 for recognition, skill 
upgradation, collateral free credit and marketing support to traditional artisan/craftsperson 
working with traditional tools. 18 trades are covered under PM Vishwakarma Scheme, 
including tailors, barbers, masons, carpenter, blacksmith, basket weaver, potter, cobbler, 
traditional toys maker, fishing net maker, etc. It is a Central Sector Scheme with practically 
useful components including recognition through PM Vishwakarma Certificate and ID Card, 
Skill Upgradation, Toolkit Incentive, Credit Support, Incentive for Digital Transactions and 
Marketing Support. Under the skill upgradation module, 5-7 days of basic skill training and 
advanced 15 days optional skill training is provided with stipend of ₹ 500 per day to offset 
wage loss and a travel allowance of ₹ 1000.
Currently 1,533 Centres covering 365 districts in 25 states/UTs are implementing training 
and additional 2000 centres are ready. For ease of credit, two bank officials each in all 
the 766 districts on pan India basis have been designated for information on know-how of 
availing credit under the scheme to the registered Vishwakarma. As on 27th May 2024, 2.14 
crore applications have been received and 11.5 lakh have been verified through a 3-level 
verification, showing the latent demand for the scheme. 4.37 lakh candidates have been 
trained/undergoing training under the programme.
8.82	 To maximise the outcomes from skilling initiatives, convergence, and utilisation of 
synergies with other employment-centric programmes would mutually benefit the two verticals. 
Linking skill development with PLI scheme and employment-linked incentive schemes in high-
growth potential sectors like toy, apparel, tourism, logistics, textiles, leather sector etc. would aid 
upgrading of skills as production moves up the value chain. On the apprenticeship promotion 
front, there remains considerable scope to add flexibility to the regulatory framework, as 
elaborated in Box VIII.9.

Box VIII.9: Re-calibrating the apprenticeship framework
Learning while doing has been considered the best way of learning and this is the best way to 
bridge the gap from theory to practice. In the manufacturing /industry parlance, it is termed 
“apprenticeship” and in the knowledge-based professions it goes by “internships”. Such 
learning opportunities act as the bridge that aids people to cross over from informal work to 
formal employment or to smooth the move from academics to the workplace. They are an 
essential component of the skilling ecosystem which is the backbone for both employment 
and entrepreneurship. 
The Apprentices Act, 1961 (Act) provides for establishments in all sectors of manufacturing 
and services with more than 30 employees to mandatorily undertake apprenticeships in a 
range from 2.5 - 15 per cent of their workforce101. Any person over the age of 14 years and with 
a minimum education of 5th standard is eligible to take up apprenticeship. The Rules provide 
6 – 36-month duration apprenticeship programmes with a minimum stipend of ₹5000 - 
9000 per month to apprentices and the rate is linked to the educational qualification of the 
candidate. The Act and the Rules have been amended in 2014, 2015, and 2019, to make it 
more liberal for establishments and apprentices. 
The National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme102 (NAPS) was introduced in August 2016 
to meet the demand for a skilled workforce, promote the industrial economy, and provide 
experiential learning opportunities to the youth. The scheme governs the engagement of 
apprentices under the Act and is funded 100 per cent by the Ministry of Skill Development 
and Entrepreneurship. It incentivises establishments by reimbursing 25 per cent of the 
prescribed stipend (subject to a maximum of ₹1500 per month) and also partially supports 
the cost of basic training. The scheme covers apprenticeship in over 261 designated trades, 
managed through the Director General of Training and the state Governments, and over 200 
optional trades, managed by the NSDC, in over 37 industry sectors. Under the scheme103, 
over 2.21 lakh establishments are registered for taking up apprentices and over 32.38 lakh 
apprentices have been engaged from FY17 to FY24. 
While the NAPS supports apprentices who have minimum formal education the National 
Apprenticeship Training Scheme104 (NATS) covers Graduate, Diploma students and 
Vocational certificate holders for practical, hands-on On-the-Job-Training based skilling 
opportunities with a duration ranging from 6 months to 1 year. The scheme, implemented 
by the Ministry of Education, has over 43,000 registered establishments and 28.66 lakh 
students who have been engaged under the scheme. It supports 50 per cent of the cost of 
such apprenticeship stipend to the establishments.

Challenges
Apprenticeship training programs in India have the potential to bridge the skills gap in the 
workforce and enhance the employability of vocational students. Empirical evidence shows 
that, in a smooth functioning apprenticeship ecosystem, a large share of firms (30 per cent 
in Germany and 60 per cent in Switzerland) recoup their investment of hiring an apprentice 
by the end of the training period, while being guided by their cost-benefit analysis in 
hiring apprentices (Muehlemann and Wolter 2014).105 Firms also retain the most eligible 
apprentices while the others seek employment elsewhere. 
There exist significant challenges in the Indian apprenticeship ecosystem, such as lack of 
coordination between education institutions and industry, inadequate infrastructure, gaps 
in the regulatory framework (Ravichandran 2023).106 Besides, the negative perception of 
vocational training as being inferior to academic education is one of the biggest challenges 
(Gupta and Dharap 2022).107 
The outcomes from the apprenticeship schemes signal scope for improvement. The NAPS 2.0 
set an ambitious target of enrol 46 lakh apprentices in the four years from 2022-23 to 2025-
26, whereas the enrolments from 2016-17 to 2021-22 were 15.96 lakh. The technological 
intervention of having a unified portal and moving payments to the direct benefit transfer 
system may have helped increase enrolments from 2.90 lakh in FY 21 to 5.80 lakh in FY 22 
but few systemic weaknesses need to be addressed if the target is to be achieved. Of more 
concern is that less than 50 percent of apprentices engaged have completed training. There 
is a lack of information on the final outcome of gainful employment for the trainees. Only 
around 47,000 of the 2.21 lakh establishments have active programmes, indicating a need to 
generate employers’ interest in apprenticeship.108
The apprenticeship framework thus needs to be re-calibrated to provide flexibility and 
negotiability in work hours, compensation, and disengagement, emulating the Swiss and 
German models of apprenticeships where students work as apprentices on weekends on 
mutually agreeable terms. The regulatory framework needs to be mindful of the cost-
benefit ratio of hiring apprentices for local firms. As it stands, apprentices’ productivity and 
working hour may vary and flexibility in the contract terms could enable mutually beneficial 
arrangements rather than closing doors for any engagement. There is a need to minimise the 
role of Government agencies in order to address the delays in the programme and ease the 
compliance requirements of establishments. Establishing a mechanism to convert the skills 
acquired at apprenticeships into gainful employment by networking between registered 
establishments and industry clusters, forward linkages with entrepreneurship schemes etc. 
would also be useful. Operationalising the matching of opportunities and demand at local 
levels such as a district or satellites areas of cities, etc., would improve outcomes.

Employment and Skill Development
317
According to Gayathri et.al.(2019), in the short term, it is important to gather statistical data 
to understand the working of the apprenticeship scheme in different sectors and regions. 
This data will help estimate the number of apprentices that can be absorbed by industries 
and workplaces. In the long run, the focus should be on effective implementation by raising 
awareness, incentivising industries, and engaging key stakeholders.109
The large share of the informal sector in employment is both a challenge and an opportunity. 
Interventions targeting skill development and upskilling in the informal sector can lead to 
an increase in productivity in these jobs and improve earnings for the cohort of unskilled 
and semi-skilled workforce. Strengthening and recalibrating the apprenticeship framework 
can be the means to make effective use of this opportunity.
CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD
8.83	 To sum up, the employment situation in India has experienced a positive transformation 
over the last decade, with notable achievements in formalisation, skill development, 
entrepreneurship, industry diversification, and inclusive growth. These trends and the 
country’s commitment to technological advancement and infrastructure development have 
positioned India as a dynamic and resilient player in the global job market. The Government 
is striving to nurture the foundations of employment creation by creating an ecosystem of 
ease of doing business, lower logistical costs, meaningful skill development, and easy credit 
for entrepreneurship. This approach may take some time to bear results, but with steadfast 
efforts and good intentions, it will facilitate sustainable employment creation for everyone in 
the country. 
8.84	 Nevertheless, there remain long-existing challenges of formalising a burgeoning workforce, 
facilitating job creation in sectors which can absorb workers shifting from agriculture, and 
ensuring social security benefits for those in regular wage/salaried employment (as per PLFS 
2022-23, 53 per cent of regular wage/salaried employees are not eligible for any social security 
benefit). The state governments can grease the wheels of hiring by businesses by easing the 
compliance burden and reforming laws on land, etc., to suit the priorities of development.
8.85	 The agro-processing sector lies at the overlap of India’s requirements of productive, 
intermediate, and large-scale job creation for rural youth and women, with rich dividends to 
reap from the convergence of schemes and a mission-mode unwavering focus at a national 
scale. The Sahyadri farmer producer company is a shining example from a long list of success 
stories.
8.86	 Concurrently, the employment landscape is fast changing worldwide, and India, aspiring 
to be a developed nation by 2047, must partake in the massive reshaping of jobs that AI has and 
is likely to further spin off. The impact of automation on workers being complex and uncertain, 
the direction of technological change remains susceptible to forces of political economy. India 
thus needs to invest in research and steer the AI bandwagon towards shared prosperity. At the 
same time, something as basic and age-old as unpaid care work needs our attention too. The

development of an affordable, reliable, and quality creche and elderly care infrastructure is the 
Achilles heel for female participation in paid work, which should be determined by comparative 
advantage and choice rather than dictated by gender.
8.87	 Finally, jobs are created in the private sector. India’s corporate sector has never had it so 
good as now, with profitability at a 15-year high in FY24. Profits had quadrupled between FY20 
and FY23. Businesses are sometimes reluctant to make investments citing lack of demand 
visibility. This could be due to external factors and internal factors such as weak employment 
growth and income growth. To that extent, the lack of demand visibility is an endogenous factor. 
Privileging capital over labour is inimical to long-term corporate growth prospects. Businesses 
have an obligation to themselves to strike the right balance between deployment of capital and 
deployment of labour. As important, capital and labour shares of income have to be fair. In 
their fascination for AI and fear of erosion of competitiveness, businesses have to bear in mind 
their responsibility for employment generation and the consequent impact on social stability. 
8.88	 With respect to skilling too, it is a priority that lends itself to market-based solutions. 
There is a skill-seeker who benefits economically from better skills; there is a skill-provider 
who earns fee income for imparting it and there are employers who benefit from a skilled 
and productive workforce. Therefore, it is a challenge that the market can solve and to the 
extent that regulatory hurdles (including, for example, land availability for setting up skilling 
facilities) stand in the way of the market solving this problem, that is the responsibility of the 
Governments – union and states – to remove them. 
8.89	 This chapter has provided a broad estimate of the number of jobs that the economy has 
to generate. Of course, not all of them will seek jobs. Some of them will be self-employed and 
some of them will be employers too. More than jobs, economic growth is about generating 
livelihoods. Technological change, geopolitical churn and climate change combine to make this 
a formidable challenge. Rising to it requires us – Governments at all levels and the private 
sector – to strive together.

AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
MANAGEMENT: PLENTY OF 
UPSIDE LEFT IF WE GET IT 
RIGHT
In the last five years, the agriculture sector has grown at an average growth rate of 
4.18 per cent per year. The country also has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, around 
40 per cent1 of which is distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India 
exports more than 7 per cent2 of its food grains. The growth in the agriculture and allied 
sectors has contributed positively to the growth of the Indian economy. 
However, specific challenges remain. Low productivity levels, the impact of variability 
in weather, fragmented land holdings and inadequate marketing infrastructure affect 
agriculture performance. The chapter discusses these aspects while also focussing on 
government interventions in the crop, livestock, animal husbandry and fisheries to 
enhance investment and productivity, provide reasonable returns to farmers through 
the minimum support price (MSP), improve access to high-quality inputs and enable 
better extension services. Looking ahead, the digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture 
are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools. The chapter 
also discusses welfare schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKAY), the National 
Food Security Act (NFSA) and India’s food management programme, including food 
procurement and allocation. 
INTRODUCTION
9.1	
The Indian agriculture sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3 per cent of the 
population and has a share of 18.2 per cent in the country’s GDP3 at current prices. The sector 
has been buoyant, which is evident from the fact that it has registered an average annual 
growth rate of 4.184 per cent at constant prices over the last five years. Several initiatives and 
measures taken by the government in the form of assured remunerative prices through MSP 
improving access to institutional credit, enabling crop diversification, promoting digitisation, 
and mechanisation, encouraging adoption of sustainable practices through organic and natural 
farming, and focusing on productivity enhancement have had a positive impact on the sector. 
As per provisional estimates for 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4

per cent,5 which is below 4.7 per cent in 2022-236, mainly because of a drop in the foodgrain 
production due to delayed and poor monsoons caused by El Nino. The allied activities - livestock 
and fisheries have performed better than the traditional crops such as cereals7, which is evident 
from an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) at current prices from 
24.38 per cent and 4.44 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.23 per cent and 7.25 per cent in 2022-238 
respectively. The share of the crops sector in Agriculture GVA at current prices in 2022-239 was 
55.28 per cent as compared to 61.75 per cent in 2014-15.
9.2	
While the country is a major agriculture producer, being the second largest producer in 
rice, wheat, cotton, among other crops, and the largest producer of milk, pulses and spices10, the 
crop yields in the country are much lower than the other major producers (Fig IX.2). That this 
is so despite the fact that the bulk of the government support goes to rice and wheat if a cause 
for reflection. Fragmented land holdings, low farm investment, lack of farm mechanisation, 
insufficient access to quality inputs, and inadequate marketing infrastructure leading to post-
harvest losses, dependency on rains and short growing seasons are a few reasons for the low 
yields.

Several interventions are being undertaken to improve productivity in agriculture in 
line with the recommendations of the Doubling Farmers Income Report (DFI) 2016, which 
identified strategies to increase crop and livestock productivity, enchancing cropping intensity, 
diversify to high-value agriculture and provide remunerative prices on farmers’ produce. The 
decision in 2018-19 to fix MSP at one and half times the all-India weighted average cost of

production was a step towards providing assured remunerative prices to farmers. Other 
interventions include income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-
KISAN), which gives the farmer a direct financial benefit of ₹6000/- per year. Promotion of 
greater efficiency in the use of inputs and sustainable production methods through Per Drop 
More Crop (PDMC), a micro irrigation scheme and the actions under the National Mission on 
Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), including the use of alternative and organic fertilisers are a 
few examples on other initiatives being undertaken to improve productivity and sustainability. 
In addition, digital initiatives such as the Digital Agriculture Mission and e-National Agriculture 
Market (e-NAM) have also been taken up to facilitate the adoption of smart agriculture 
technologies, with the latter allowing better price discovery.  
9.4	
The roles, animal husbandry and fisheries play in improving farmers’ income, especially 
when agriculture holdings are reduced, is duly recognised.  The scheme such as the Rashtriya 
Gokul Mission(RGM), National Digital Livestock Mission4 (NDLM), and National Programme 
for Dairy Development (NPDD) include interventions to improve quality, enable access to the 
organised markets and the development of indigenous breeds. The fisheries sector has been 
supported through programmes for improving productivity, access to institutional credit, and 
infrastructure development through the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) 
with a total fund size of ₹7.52 Thousand Crore. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada 
Yojana (PMMSY) introduced in May 2020 aimed at strengthening fisheries infrastructure, 
enable technology infusion and promote optimal water management. These interventions in 
fisheries sector have resulted in increasing fish production by an average annual growth of 7.4 
per cent in 2022-23 from 2020-2111.

AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION: PERFORMANCE AND 
PROMOTING CROP DIVERSIFICATION
9.5	
In 2022-23, foodgrain production hit an all-time high of 329.7 million tonnes, and 
oilseeds production reached 41.4 million tonnes. In 2023-24, food grain production is slightly 
lower at 328.8 million tonnes 12, primarily because of poor and delayed monsoons. Production 
of other crops such as Shree Anna/nutri cereals and total oilseeds marked a slight increase. 
The nutri-cereals increased marginally by 1 per cent from the previous year, as did Tur, with a 
production estimated at 33.85 lakh tonnes (LT) as compared to last year’s production of 33.12 
LT. With the harvesting still in progress, there may be further changes in successive estimates.. 
The production of lentil (Masur) is estimated at 17.54 LT, which is higher by 1.95 LT than the 
previous year’s production of 15.59 LT.

In recent years, the Government has promoted crop diversification to address sustainability 
challenges and shift production from water-intensive crops to others such as pulses, oilseeds, 
and Nutri-cereals/ Shree Anna. The government is implementing the Crop Diversification 
Programme (CDP) under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas yoajna (RKVY) to demonstrate and 
promote better production technologies of alternate crops for the diversion of paddy 
cultivation and to restore soil fertility through the cultivation of legumes. The National Food 
Security Mission (NFSM) is implemented across the country to enhance the production and 
productivity of foodgrain and commercial crops through the demonstration of crop production 
and protection technologies, access to high-yielding varieties, integrated nutrient and pest 
management techniques, efficient water saving devices, and capacity building of farmers etc. 
The government’s push towards crop diversification is facilitated through a higher increase in

MSP over the average cost of production for oilseeds and pulses with lentils (masur), getting 
the highest among pulses at 89 per cent over the cost of production, followed by tur at 58 per 
cent in 2023-24 while MSP for coarse cereal/millets such as bajra was 82 per cent over the cost 
of production. The increase in MSP for safflower and soybean (yellow) was 52 per cent over 
the cost of production in 2023-24. This needs to be persisted with to address the imbalance 
between the production of rice and wheat and the production of pulses and oilseeds. 
9.7	
The Government has been implementing a National Food Security Mission- Oilseeds & 
Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP), from 2018-19 to augment the availability of vegetable oils through 
improved productivity and increase in acreage under cultivation. The total area coverage of 
all oilseeds has expanded significantly, increasing from 25.60 million hectares in 2014-15 to 
30.08 million hectares in 2023-24 (17.5 per cent growth). The domestic availability of edible 
oil has risen from 86.30 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 121.33 lakh tonnes in 2023-24. This has 
reduced the percentage share of imported edible oil, from 63.2 per cent in 2015-16 to 57.3 per 
cent in 2022-23, despite rising domestic demand and consumption patterns. A remunerative 
minimum support price for rapeseed and mustard (which was at 98 per cent over cost in 2022-
23) is also providing the incentive to farmers to diversify production13. 
Promoting Investment and Access to credit in Agriculture and allied 
sectors 
9.8	 Gross capital formation (GCF) refers to the total investment in physical assets over a 
specific period. It includes new and existing fixed assets, such as machinery, buildings, land 
improvements, equipment purchases, and inventory changes14. This metric is a crucial indicator 
of investment in modernising agriculture, enhancing productivity, and ensuring sustainability. 
The development of infrastructure, particularly post-harvest facilities, can significantly reduce 
waste, preserve produce quality, and increase farmers’ income. The GCF of the agriculture 
sector and the share of GCF in the agriculture and allied sectors as a percentage of  Gross 
Value Added (GVA) has been growing steadily, mainly due to increased public investment. The 
GCF of the agriculture sector grew at the rate of 19.04 per cent in 2022-23, and the GCF as a 
percentage of GVA rose from 17.7 per cent in 2021-22 to 19.9 per cent in 2022-23, suggesting 
an increase in investment in agriculture15. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016-17 to 
2022-23 was 9.70 per cent16. 
9.9	
However, despite the increasing trend in GCF, there is a need to further boost agriculture 
investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers’ income. The DFI 2016 report 
indicated that to double farmers’ income over the period of 2016-17 to 2022-23, income would 
need to grow at an annual rate of 10.4 per cent in the farm sector, which in turn would require 
an annual growth rate in agriculture investment of 12.5 per cent17. One significant challenge

9.10	 Subsidies have also played a significant role in influencing farmer behaviour towards 
adopting better quality seeds, encouraging the use of appropriate composition and quantity of 
fertiliser, and improving access to farm machines from custom hiring centres. Subsidies to the 
agriculture sector more than doubled between 2011-12 and 2020-21, with the fastest increase 
seen in fertiliser and power. As a result, while public investments grew at the same rate as the 
subsidies, they remained at about one-third of the subsidies19.
9.11	 Input subsidies support short-term increases in agricultural productivity and farmer 
incomes.20 Higher investment levels, on the other hand, are required for the long-term 
modernisation of this sector, for which active participation from private corporate entities is 
needed, especially in post-harvest infrastructure.
9.12	 Recognising the need to crowd in private investments, the government, since 2014, has been 
implementing the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme of the Integrated 
Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), under which capital subsidy is provided, with the 
objective to improving the extent of storage infrastructure.  It is a demand-driven, credit-linked 
scheme offering subsidies of 25 per cent (for the plains) and 33.33 per cent (for North-East and

hilly regions) to individuals, farmers, FPOs, cooperatives, and state agencies. As of 30th April 
2024, 48357 projects were sanctioned for storage infrastructure with ₹4570 Crore released 
as subsidy, and 20878 other projects21 are also under progress with ₹2084 Crore released as 
subsidy. To give further fillip to farm gate infrastructure and also involve the private sector 
more actively, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) was launched with a financing facility 
of ₹1 lakh Crore to be disbursed between FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26 with support extending till 
FY 2032-33. The AIF provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and 
community farming projects, offering interest subvention and credit guarantee support. As of 
5th July 2024, AIF mobilised an investment of ₹73194 Crore, supporting 17196 custom hiring 
centres, 14868 primary processing units, 13165 warehouses, 2942 sorting and grading units, 
1792 cold storage projects, and 18981 other projects. In addition, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan 
SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) introduced credit-linked financial assistance through grants-in-
aid to build efficient supply chain management from farm to retail to reduce the wastage of 
perishable produce and extend food shelf life. Under PMKSY 1044 projects were completed 
till end March 2024. A total of 1685 projects with project cost ₹ 32.78 Thousand Crore and 
approved subsidy of ₹ 9.3 Thousand Crore have been approved till end March 2024. 
Empowering farmers through affordable and enhanced access to credit
9.13	 Indian agriculture continues to be dominated by small landholders. About 89.4 per cent 
of farm households own less than 2 hectares of land.22 The ability of the farmers to invest in 
their farmlands directly depends on access to affordable credit. The government’s priority has 
been to provide timely, cost-effective, and adequate credit that reduces the dependence on non-
institutional credit and increases investment. The measures have reduced the share of non-
institutional credit from 90 per cent in 1950 to 23.40 per cent in 2021-2223. As of 31 January 
2024, the total credit disbursed to agriculture amounted to ₹ 22.84 lakh Crore, with ₹13.67 
lakh Crore allocated to crop loans (short term) and ₹ 9.17 lakh Crore to term loans24.
9.14	 The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) has streamlined agricultural credit accessibility. As of 
January 31, 2024, banks issued 7.5 crores KCC with a limit of ₹9.4 lakh crores. As a further 
measure, the KCC was extended to meet the working capital needs of fisheries and animal 
husbandry activities in 2018-19, along with the enhancement of the limit for collateral-free 
loans to ₹1.6 lakh. In the case of a Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) among borrowers, milk unions, 
& banks, the collateral-free loan can go up to ₹3 lakh.25 As of March 31, 2024, 3.49 lakh KCC 
and 34.5 lakh KCC were issued to fisheries and animal husbandry activities, respectively. In 
addition, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)26 have emerged as an essential source of credit for 
tenant farmers. JLG accounts have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.76 
per cent over the past five years, emerging as a vital source in meeting the credit needs of tenant 
farmers and marginalised segments.

9.15	 Insurance schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) offer a safety 
net against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, or diseases, ensuring financial stability 
for farmers. These schemes safeguard farmers’ livelihoods and encourage them to adopt modern 
farming practices and technologies. PMFBY is the largest crop insurance scheme in the world 
in terms of farmer enrolment and is the third largest scheme in terms of insurance premiums. 
The scheme provides a simple and affordable crop insurance product to ensure comprehensive 
risk cover for crops to farmers against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to 
post-harvest. The overall insured area in 2023-24 reached 610 lakh ha compared to 500.2 lakh 
ha in 2022-23. A total of 5549.40 Lakh farmer applications were insured under the scheme 
since 2016-17, and ₹150589.10 Crore has been paid as claims. High premium costs compared 
to insurance claims, delays in settling claims, lack of transparency, and uniform premium rates 
that do not account for different conditions across states have impacted the performance of the 
scheme.27 Another study also indicates that cumbersome procedure of paying premiums, lack 
of bank facilities near the village and poor awareness of the scheme among small and marginal 
farmers have limited the impact of the scheme.28

are implementing Yes-Tech from the Kharif 2023 season onwards. 
●  Weather Information Network & Data System (WINDS)- is a pioneering 
initiative to set up a network of Automatic Weather Stations & Rain Gauges at Taluk/
Block and Gram Panchayat (GP) levels for use of all farmer and farming-oriented 
services. It is proposed that an automatic rain gauge (ARG) would be installed at every 
GP and an automatic weather station (AWS) at every block covered under PMFBY.
●  Collection of Real-time Observations and Photographs of Crops (CROPIC)- 
is an initiative that has been taken up to collect periodic photographs of crops during 
their life cycle. These photographs will validate sown and insured crops, assess crop 
damage when any localised and widespread calamity or climatic condition affects the 
crops, and act as an input for Technology-based yield estimation models.
Agriculture Marketing-Reaping prosperity
9.16	 A comprehensive and diversified marketing network enables the farmer to bring the 
produce to the market most efficiently and timely. It reduces post-harvest losses, enhances 
competition, and allows price discovery.  With the increase in marketable surplus, it has become 
all the more essential to provide the farming community with better marketing facilities.  
Delays in farmers accessing formal institutions, including for government procurement at the 
Agricultural Price Marketing Committee (APMC), enhance reliance on intermediaries29. 
9.17	 The average area served by mandis in the country is 434.48 sq. km against the 
recommendation of the National Commission on Farmers (2006) of the market within a 
radius of 5 Km (corresponding market area of about 80 sq. km.). The physical constraints in 
transporting produce to mandis present another layer of difficulty, particularly for small and 
marginal farmers who may have to travel long distances30. 
9.18	 To Promote efficiency in agriculture marketing, and improve price discovery, the 
government implemented the e-NAM Scheme. Under the e-NAM Scheme, the Government

provides free software and assistance of ₹75 Lakh per APMC mandi for related hardware, 
including quality assaying equipment and the creation of infrastructure for cleaning, grading, 
sorting, packaging, etc. As of 14th March 2024, more than 1.77 Crore farmers and 2.56 Lakh 
traders have been registered on the e-NAM portal. The Government of India launched the 
scheme to form and promote 10,000 FPOs in 2020 with a budget outlay of ₹6.86 Thousand 
Crore till 2027-28. As of 29 February 2024, 8,195 FPOs have registered under the new FPO 
scheme, and equity grants of ₹157.4 Crore were released to 3,325 FPOs. Credit guarantee cover 
worth ₹278.2 Crore was issued to 1,185 FPOs. 
9.19	 Studies have evaluated the performance and prospects of the e-NAM31 and concluded 
that the initiative has generally had a positive impact on farmers by enabling higher price 
realisation for their crops, thus fulfilling one of its primary objectives. Farmers who participated 
in e-NAM reported receiving higher prices for their crops post-implementation. About 66 per 
cent of farmers from the surveyed states found the quality testing procedures transparent32. A 
significant proportion of farmers (82 per cent, 79 per cent, 64 per cent, and 89 per cent) in states 
like Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Telangana, respectively, observed better pricing and 
reduced transaction costs. Overall, farmers expressed satisfaction with the e-NAM facilities, 
including cleaning, drying, weighing, assaying, bid management, and e-auction. Similarly, 
it is seen that 54 per cent of the farmers prefer transactions through the eNAM portal over 
traditional markets due to the multiple benefits derived through this portal33. Implementation 
challenges of e-NAM still exist, such as limited awareness, lack of trust and infrastructure issues 
related to setting up assaying facilities. 
Box IX. 2: Futures market for agriculture commodities in India
The establishment of a forward market in commodities was driven by the recognition that 
while the production of agricultural products was largely seasonal and subject to various 
risks, consumption was not. The forward market serves as a mechanism that brings the 
prospects of future production and consumption to influence today’s price in a logical 
manner. This process, among other things, establishes a link between present and future 
production and consumption cycles, thereby facilitating the inter-temporal smoothing of 
prices. This understanding of the forward market is crucial in comprehending the evolution 
and current state of the Indian agricultural commodity markets (Bhattacharya, 2007).

Evolution: The Indian commodity derivatives market has a long history. India had around 
300 commodity exchanges during the 1940s. Until 1952, trading in these exchanges was not 
regulated by a standard policy or a market regulator. After independence, the GoI formulated 
the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act of 1952 and set up the Forward Market Commission 
(FMC) in 1953 as the regulator. In 1966, a comprehensive ban on futures trading was imposed 
to control price volatility. At different times, the GoI appointed different committees to look 
into the feasibility of reintroducing commodity derivatives trading. 
Agriculture futures trade in India got a major revival in 2003 with the setting up of 
national exchanges such as the National Commodity and Derivative Exchange (NCDEX), 
Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), and National Multi Commodity Exchange (NMCE). A 
significant development in the Indian commodity regulatory landscape happened in 2015 
when the GoI repealed the Forward Contracts Regulation Act 1952 (FCRA), and Commodity 
derivatives markets were brought under the Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act (SCRA), 
1956 with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) taking over from the Forward 
Market Commission as the commodity market regulator in September 2015. In parallel,  
e-NAM were introduced by the GoI in 2016 to provide farmers with an electronic online 
marketplace for agricultural produce. Electronic spot markets for commodities are crucial 
in integrating localised physical markets, establishing a direct link between the buyer and 
seller and providing a transparent price discovery mechanism.
Current state of play: The commodity futures market can effectively contribute to 
price discovery only when many consumers, producers, traders, and aggregators use these 
markets to hedge their risk. The interplay of these participants, speculators, and arbitrageurs 
provides liquidity and helps price discovery for longer periods. However, given that most 
Indian farmers are marginal with fragmented land holdings, they are often left without 
the necessary wherewithal to engage/participate in these markets effectively, leading to 
reduced depth in the Indian commodity futures market. Further, it is also observed that 
the requirement of standardised exchange contracts with specified quality parameters and 
delivery requirements has also impeded the majority of Indian farmers from effectively 
engaging in the commodity futures market since the Indian farmers produce different 
varieties of commodities in widely varying qualities due to varied geographical, weather, 
and soil conditions. Additionally, periodic bans imposed by GoI on futures trading on agri-
commodities as one of the measures to counter food inflation have also had implications on 
the traded value and price volume in Indian commodity and derivative exchanges.
The way forward: Studies point out that the Indian commodity market can be strengthened 
through a sequenced diversification of agri-future portfolio. As is highlighted in the 2008 
Abhijit Sen Committee Report, “combining prudence with the benefit of the doubt, the best 
course of action would be to identify those commodities where there is the possibility of 
futures trading affecting expectations that may influence inflation in essential commodities 
and insulate these from futures.” Sensitive commodities (e.g., common rice, wheat, most 
pulses, etc.) may be kept outside the ambit of the futures market until the markets are 
developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort in diversifying the portfolio. The 
agriculture futures market may focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex 
(oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maise), cotton, basmati rice, spices, etc. 
As part of recent policy initiatives to broaden the commodity derivatives market, the

Economic Survey 2023-24
330
Government of India, on March 1, 2024, expanded the list of commodities eligible for 
derivatives trading from 91 to 104. The new commodities added to the list include Apples, 
Cashews, Garlic, Skimmed Milk Powder, White butter, Weather, Processed timber products, 
Processed bamboo products, etc.
Once the regulators provide clear direction regarding the choice of commodities, they 
must stay the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions. Farmer 
Producer Organisations can play a significant role in effectively linking small and dispersed 
farmers in India and the Commodity markets eco-system. The role of Government, SEBI, 
and Commodity Exchanges in promoting FPOs in various segments of agri-commodities 
across the country is pivotal. Skilling and hand-holding the FPOs through financial literacy 
initiatives can go a long way in encouraging the farmers to benefit from the Agri-derivative 
markets. As the depth and liquidity in the agri-derivative market increases in the long -run, 
banning futures trading may no longer be required to stabilise prices unless there is data-
backed evidence of futures trading driving up price volatility. The regulator should closely 
watch the futures market and undertake regular reviews given the fluctuations in domestic 
production, consumption, and global trade.
Assured Remunerative Prices and Other Income Support Measures
9.20	 Agricultural price support assures farmers of remunerative returns and allows the 
Government to ensure a stable supply of staples at reasonable prices. Minimum Support Price 
is a factor farmers take into account when making sowing decisions. In India, the government 
has implemented price policies to encourage the production of food grains, pulses, oilseeds, and 
nutri-cereals. These policies are designed to provide a safety net to farmers by guaranteeing a 
minimum price for their produce, thus protecting them from the volatility of market prices. The 
Union Budget for 2018-19 announced that farmers in India would be given an MSP of at least 
one and a half times the cost of production. Accordingly, the Government has been increasing 
the MSP for all 22 Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a margin of at least 50 per cent 
over the all-India weighted average cost of production since the agricultural year 2018-19.

9.21	 Another initiative towards increasing farmers’ income is PM-KISAN - a central sector 
scheme launched on 24 February 2019 to supplement the financial needs of land-holding 
farmers, subject to exclusions. Under the scheme, an economic benefit of ₹6000/- per year is 
transferred in three equal four-monthly instalments into the bank accounts of farmers’ families 
across the country through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. More than ₹3.24 lakh Crore 
has been released to more than 11 crore farmers as of 10 July 2024. 
9.22	 To provide social security to the most vulnerable farmer families, the Government 
implements Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The scheme offers a monthly 
pension of ₹3,000 to the enrolled farmers on the attainment of 60 years of age, based on a 
nominal premium between ₹55 to ₹200 per month paid by the applicant (in the age group 18 
to 40 years) subject to exclusion criteria. As per the Ministry of Agriculture, as of 07 July 2024, 
23.41 lakh farmers have enrolled under the scheme. 
Farm Mechanisation- Powering agriculture
9.23	 Agricultural mechanisation covering simple hand tools to more complex machinery has 
become essential to modern agriculture and contributes towards productivity. Considering that 
most farmers in India are small and marginal, providing machinery through custom hiring 
can enhance the adoption of farm mechanisation among these farmers and in regions where 
mechanisation levels are currently low. The Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) 
provides assistance to the State Government for training and demonstration of agricultural 
machinery, setting up of Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) and assists farmers in procuring various 
farm machinery and equipment. The total funds allocated under SMAM from 2014-15 to 2023-
24 was ₹7.26 Thousand Crore. In 2023-24, the allocation was ₹859.45 Crore. Further, Farm 
Machinery Banks promote access to high-tech machinery for small and marginal farm holdings 
and farm holdings under challenging areas with low levels of mechanisation. During the period 
2014-15 to 2023-24, 25527 CHC were established under the scheme, and 607 CHC were set up 
in 2023-24. 
Making Agriculture Sustainable
9.24	 A growing challenge in agriculture pertains to sustainability issues like overexploitation, 
degradation of natural resources, and addressing the impact of climate change. The agricultural 
methods and inputs used have also had significant implications for sustainable agriculture. 
For example, increased use of fertiliser and chemicals, overexploitation, and unsustainable 
use of water resources have affected soil health and fertility.  Variability in weather conditions 
and the relative predominance of rainfed agriculture also impact production and productivity. 
Sustainability in agriculture is highly relevant to securing the long-term productivity of land 
holdings, ensuring sufficient farm-based incomes and food security. With 11 of the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) directly linked to agriculture, securing improvements in crop yields 
and ensuring income stability is vital for the country as it strives to achieve the Agenda 2030 
goals. 
9.25	  The climate change impact assessment carried out by the government underscores the 
need for adaptation in the sector. In the absence of the adoption of adaptation measures, 
rainfed rice yields in India are projected to drop by 20 per cent in 2050 and 47 per cent in 2080 
scenarios, while irrigated rice yields are projected to reduce by 3.5 per cent in 2050 and 5 per 

Economic Survey 2023-24
332
cent in 2080 scenarios. Climate change is projected to reduce wheat yield by 19.3 per cent in 
2050 and 40 per cent in 2080 scenarios34. 
9.26	  National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, a part of the National Action Plan on 
Climate Change (NAPCC), aims to evolve and implement strategies to make Indian agriculture 
more resilient to the changing climate. One of the most critical interventions in the face of 
changing climate is to ensure that farmland gets assured irrigation. In this context, Rainfed Area 
Development (RAD), implemented under the NMSA to enhance productivity and minimise 
risks associated with climatic variability, is germane. An amount of ₹1.74 Thousand Crore has 
been released & an area of 7.33 Lakh hectares has been covered under the RAD programme. 
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), consisting of two major components, the 
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) and Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP), promote 
the extension of areas under irrigation and water efficiency. Irrigation area coverage increased 
from 49.3 per cent of gross cropped area (GCA) in 2015-16 to 55 in 2020-21. Similarly, irrigation 
intensity (ratio of gross irrigated area to net irrigated area) recorded a rise of 10.3 percentage 
points, from 144.2 per cent in 2015-16 to around 154.5 per cent in 2021-22, while cropping 
intensity increased by 12.8 percentage points during this period35. A Micro Irrigation Fund 
(MIF) of an initial corpus ₹5 thousand Crore has also been created with NABARD to facilitate 
the States in mobilising the resources for expanding coverage of micro irrigation. Further, 
PDMC scheme also supports micro-level water harvesting, storage, management, etc. An area 
of 90.0 Lakh hectares has been covered under micro irrigation in the country under the PDMC 
from 2015-16 to 2023-24 as of 6th February 202436.
Box-IX.3: Policy led interventions to improve water management-National 
and International Experience37
Automation of Irrigation System: Narayanpur Left Bank Canal System 
(Karnataka)
The Narayanpur Left Bank Canal (NLBC) system in Karnataka was facing significant 
challenges such as inadequate water regulation, manual control of gates, and inequitable 
water distribution. To address these issues, the government implemented an automation 
system that included over 4,000 automated control and regulating gates, solar-powered 
integrated gates, and a master VSAT communication system. These interventions have 
optimised water use efficiency, improved equitable distribution, and enhanced overall 
agricultural productivity in the region.
Diversion-Based Irrigation System

based irrigation (DBI) systems. These systems use gravity flow to divert water from streams 
to agricultural fields. Since 2016, 13 DBI systems have been operationalised, bringing 111 
hectares of land under irrigation and benefiting 93 farmers. The cost-effective nature of 
these systems, requiring approximately ₹300 per running meter, makes them a viable 
solution for enhancing irrigation coverage in hilly terrains.
Growing Tomatoes Without Soil Using Vertical Farming in Hydroponics
Vertical farming with hydroponics allows the cultivation of tomatoes without soil, offering 
numerous benefits such as space efficiency, reduced water usage, and year-round production. 
This method has been implemented in Port Augusta Farm, South Australia, which features a 
4.5-hectare greenhouse powered by a 51,500 m² concentrated solar power plant. This plant 
includes 23,000 mirrors that direct sunlight to a 127-meter-high tower weighing 234 tons. 
The generated heat serves three purposes: maintaining optimal temperatures in 20 hectares
of greenhouses, generating electricity via a turbine to power farm systems, and desalinating 
seawater drawn from the nearby Spencer Gulf. The farm produces one million liters of 
fresh water daily by desalinating seawater from 3 kilometers away. It grows 7,000 tonnes 
of tomatoes annually, which accounts for 15 per cent of Australia’s total crop, on arid land. 
In addition, 180,000 tomatoes are grown hydroponically in stacks without soil, saving 2 
million liters of diesel and reducing CO2 emissions by 15,000 tons compared to traditional 
farming methods.
This method entails growing plants in nutrient-rich water solutions customized to their 
specific requirements. Vertical hydroponic systems can be employed in urban areas, reducing 
the environmental impact of transportation and offering locally sourced fresh produce.
Temporary Flood Water Storage in Agricultural Areas in the Middle Tisza River 
Basin
In the Middle Tisza River Basin, temporary floodwater storage in agricultural areas is being 
used to reduce flood risks and provide extra irrigation. By storing excess floodwater in 
specific agricultural fields, the region can better control water levels, decreasing the risk of 
flooding downstream. This method not only safeguards infrastructure but also improves 
soil fertility by depositing nutrients from the floodwaters, leading to increased agricultural 
productivity.
These interventions demonstrate innovative water management and agricultural productivity 
approaches, addressing specific regional challenges with tailored solutions.
9.27	 Another area of intervention is focused on reducing the use of chemical fertilisers in 
Indian agriculture. Even while the per-hectare usage of agricultural chemicals in India remains 
significantly lower than in most developed countries, its use of chemical fertilisers has increased 
over the years38. In fact, here it may be noted that the current subsidy structure has contributed to 
an increased application of urea, which has impacted the nutrient imbalance in the use of major 
plant nutrients, nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK), affecting the efficiency of fertiliser 
use, the quality of soil and output39and environment. Revising subsidy policies to support all

major nutrients (N, P, K) can incentivise farmers to use a more balanced approach. While the 
composition is important, so is the quantity of application. With the view to building knowledge 
and capacity among farmers, demonstrations to administer precise fertiliser application were 
carried out with more than 1.79 Lakh drones across several states.  
9.28	 The PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness Generation, Nourishment, and 
Amelioration of Mother Earth (PM-PRANAM ) initiative incentivises states to reduce chemical 
fertiliser use. It promotes sustainable methods such as the use of alternative fertilisers, viz. 
Nano Urea, Nano DAP, and organic fertiliser. Under the said scheme, 50 per cent of the fertiliser 
subsidy saved by a State/UT in a particular financial year by way of a reduction in consumption 
of chemical fertilisers (Urea, DAP, NPK, MOP) compared to the previous three years’ average 
consumption, will be passed on to that State/UT as a grant. In addition to these initiatives, the 
Soil Health Card Scheme was introduced to optimise the usage of nutrients. The introduction 
of “Urea Gold”, which is urea infused with sulphur to address sulphur deficiencies, has been 
another measure to improve the nutrient balance in the soil. 
9.29	 Organic and natural farming provides chemical-free fertiliser and pesticide-free food 
grains and other crops, improving soil health and reducing environmental pollution. About 
68.05 Lakh ha was brought under organic farming by 2022-23. Sikkim became the first state in 
the world to become fully organic, and other states, including Tripura and Uttarakhand, have 
set similar targets. The Government has also been promoting organic farming by implementing 
two dedicated schemes, i.e., Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic 
Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) since 2015 through cluster/
FPO formation. PKVY Scheme is being implemented in a cluster mode (with a minimum of 20 
ha size). Financial assistance of ₹31,500 per ha for three years, out of which ₹15,000 is given 
as an incentive for organic inputs provided directly through DBT. Under PKVY, as of 2022-23, 
48,144 clusters totalling 13.98 Lakh ha area and 24.22 Lakh farmers have been covered. 
Box-IX.4: Flexible, farmer-friendly and ecologically sustainable 
fertiliser subsidy: A suggested way forward
The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Chemicals & Fertilisers, in their Thirty-Ninth 
Report, titled ‘Nano-Fertilisers for sustainable crop production and maintaining soil health’, 
presented on March 29, 2023, underscored the urgency of the following issue: Fertiliser 
consumption in India is imbalanced, and Urea accounts for more than 82 per cent of 
the nitrogenous fertilisers applied to the majority of the crops. As a result, the Nitrogen, 
Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK) consumption ratio has widened from 4:3.2:1 in 2009-
10 to 7:2.8:1 in 2019-20. This imbalance, leading to the deterioration in soil quality and 
health hazards, necessitates an immediate re-examination of urea subsidy management in 
agriculture while also considering the sustainability aspects in the long run.
The current design of fertiliser subsidy in India: Based on the recommended dose 
of nutrients (RDN) calculated by each state40, the Government of India calculates the 
recommended dose of fertiliser (RDF) and allocates fertilisers to States for each season.
The States, in turn, sell the fertiliser to the farmers through dealers and primary agriculture

cooperative societies using POS devices. Based on the quantity of fertilisers sold to farmers, 
the Department of Fertilisers pays fertiliser subsidies to the fertiliser companies. However, 
there are some critical issues with the current design. This includes the following:
●  PoS devices at fertiliser outlets are not integrated with land record data
●  Any person having an Aadhaar, whether a farmer or not, can buy any quantity of fertilisers
●  No limit on the sale of fertiliser to one person or one family
●  Adverse financial and ecological impacts such as diversion of subsidised fertiliser for 
non-agriculture purposes; overuse of fertilisers which adversely affect the soil health; 
shortage of fertiliser; waste of public resources and health hazards.
Using Agri Stack to improve the targeting of fertiliser subsidy: Agri Stack is the 
digital foundation set up by the government to make it easier to bring various stakeholders 
together to improve agriculture in India and enable better outcomes and results for the
farmers by using data and digital services. It is now fairly well developed in the major Indian 
States and can provide the right tool through which the fertiliser subsidy may be better 
targeted. This will ensure that subsidised fertilisers are sold to only those identified as 
farmers or authorised by the farmer, and the quantity of subsidised fertiliser is fixed based 
on parameters such as land ownership and prominent crops of the district (comprising at 
least 70 per cent of sown area in a season). The parameters may be later refined based on 
crop grown and soil nutrient status (in convergence with the Soil Health card scheme and 
provisions may be made to provide top-up entitlement in case of crop damage or calamities 
caused by volatilities in weather conditions, in convergence with State diaster response fund 
(SDRF) / National diaster response fund (NDRF). 
E-RUPI, a seamless one-time payment mechanism, can be utilised to provide the necessary 
subsidy to the farmer directly. This system ensures that the Subsidy can only be used 
through registered PoS devices at authorised fertiliser outlets. Suppose a farmer purchases 
a quantity of fertilisers that is less than their entitlement. In that case, the remaining subsidy 
can be used to purchase other agricultural inputs, such as seeds and pesticides, also sold at 
these outlets. Any unused subsidy at the end of the year can also be converted into a small 
savings instrument in the farmer’s name at a post office. This system not only streamlines the 
subsidy distribution process but also prevents the misuse of subsidies for non-agricultural 
purposes. This will give an incentive to the farmer not to use excessive Urea on account of 
being cheaper than the other NPK fertiliser and may lead to balanced use of fertilisers as per 
the requirement of the crop & soil.
Some fundamental aspects that would be required to ensure the efficiency of the new 
mechanism will be as follows:
●  Integration of PoS devices with farmer’s registry in Agri Stack and the farmer’s registry 
will include the Aadhaar number of each farmer, details of all agricultural lands owned 
by the farmer as per Record of Rights (RoR), and dynamic updation of land ownership 
data through mutation module
●  Facility to include name, Aadhaar number and other details of family members and any 
other person authorised to buy subsidised fertilisers
●  Facility to update bank details, mobile numbers and other details of farmers, family 
members, and authorised persons
●  Crop sown registry based on digital crop survey to be integrated at a later stage

Way Forward 
Fertiliser administration reforms have been carried out in other countries, wherein the 
fertiliser requirement has been based on standard norms. In India, as it involves a paradigm 
shift and fertiliser is a sensitive subject, it may be prudent to carry out pilots in one district of 
a few States, which have relatively robust and well-developed agri-stack systems. Based on 
the results of these pilots, the decision on the future mode of fertiliser subsidy administration 
may be made, considering all the relevant factors.
9.30	 The government is implementing the Crop Residue Management Scheme from 2018-
19 to support the efforts of the Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi to address 
air pollution and subsidise machinery required to manage crop residue. Under the scheme, 
financial support is also given to take up large-scale demonstrations of the Bio-Decomposer 
on farmers’ fields, a microbial consortium of fungal species that accelerates the in-situ 
decomposition of paddy straw. During the 2023 season, the bio-decomposer was used by the 
States in an area of around 7.00 lakh hectares. During the period from 2018-19 to 2023-24, the 
funds amounting to ₹ 3.34 Thousand Crore have been released to Punjab, Haryana, UP, NCT of 
Delhi and Implementing Agencies like the Indian Council for Agriculture Research(ICAR) etc. 
The states have established more than 40,000 CHCs of crop residue management machines, 
and more than 2.95 lakh crop residue management machines have been supplied to these CHCs 
and individual farmers in these states. Through these initiatives of the Government for in-situ 
and ex-situ management of paddy straw, the paddy stubble burning incidences in the States of 
Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were lower by 24 per cent in the 2023 season as compared 
to the year before.
Box IX.5: Digital Agriculture: Path to digital revolution
India’s agricultural sector is undergoing a significant transformation with the integration 
of digital technologies. The Digital Agriculture Mission 2021–2025 aims to modernise 
agriculture through advanced technologies like AI, remote sensing, drones, etc. Further, 
per the Budget Announcement for 2023-24, the government has taken various initiatives to 
build Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for agriculture as an open source, open standard 
and interoperable public good. DPI will enable inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through 
relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, 
credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for growth 
of agri- tech industry and start-ups. 
Agri Stack is one of the prominent DPIs with three foundational registries (databases) i.e. 
Farmers’ Registry/Database, Geo-referenced village maps and the Crop Sown Registry/
Database, along with several Support Registries/Databases. The 3 foundational Registries 
will enable digitally authenticable Identities and non-repudiable digital assets for the farmer 
in the form of Farmer IDs, geo-tagged farm plots and Crop crop-sown data. The Krishi 
Decision Support System (Krishi-DSS) is another DPI, which aims to integrate and store in 
a standardized form relevant geospatial and non-geospatial data, such as remote-sensing 
data, weather data, soil data, crop signature library, reservoir data, groundwater data, and 
data pertaining to Government schemes.

Agriculture and Food Management
337
Further, other initiatives have been taken to strengthen the agriculture sector, such as 
(i) Krishi Mapper - a geospatial mobile application for all the land-based schemes, which 
enables geo-fencing (polygon creation / latitude-longitude) capture also incorporating Geo- 
tagged photographs from the current location of survey / inspection, (ii) Comprehensive 
Soil Fertility and Profile Mapping – for suitable soil health-related interventions, (iii) Digital 
General Crop Estimation Survey - accurately measure crop yields, through crop cutting 
experiments on randomly selected plots.
The push towards digital agriculture in India is supported by a robust ecosystem which 
visualises support of over 1,000 agri-tech startups in agriculture and allied sectors. As of 9 
February, 2024, 554 agri-start-ups, including 387 women-led start-ups, are working in the 
agriculture & allied sector.
ALLIED SECTORS: ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, DAIRYING AND 
FISHERIES ARE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DRIVERS
9.31	 The allied sectors of Indian agriculture are steadily emerging as robust growth centres and 
promising sources for improving farm incomes. From 2014-15 to 2022-23, the livestock sector 
grew at an impressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.38 per cent at constant 
prices. The contribution of livestock to the total GVA (at constant prices) in agriculture and 
allied sectors increased from 24.32 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.38 per cent in 2022-23. In 2022-
23, the livestock sector contributed 4.66 per cent of the total GVA, significantly boosting the 
per capita availability of milk, eggs, and meat. The fisheries sector, a crucial contributor to 
the Indian economy, makes up about 6.72 per cent of the agricultural GVA and has grown 
at compound  annual rate of 8.9 per cent between 2014-15 and 2022-23 (at constant prices). 
This “sunrise sector” supports approximately 30 million people, particularly marginalised and 
vulnerable communities.

9.32	 Recognising the increasing relevance of the allied sector in agricultural growth and as 
a buoyant source of farm income, several government initiatives are being implemented to 
enhance productivity, ensure animal health, and facilitate infrastructure development. The 
interventions include a focus on improving animal health (Livestock Health and Disease 
Control Programme), nurturing entrepreneurship development and per-animal productivity 
(National Livestock Mission) and promoting FPOs and Self-Help Groups. The Animal 
Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) facilitates investments from individual 
entrepreneurs, private companies, FPOs, and Section 8 companies and Diary Cooperative 
(included by merging Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund in AHIDF) in 
key areas like dairy processing, meat processing, animal feed plants, and breed improvement 
technology. The government provides a 3 per cent interest subvention to the borrower and a 
credit guarantee of up to 25 per cent of total borrowing. As of May 2024, 408 projects have been 
sanctioned by the lending banks/ NABARD/NDDB worth ₹13.861 Crore, generating 40,000 
direct employment opportunities and benefiting more than 42 lakh farmers. 
9.33	 In 2022-23, India achieved a record fish production of 17.54 million tons, ranking 
third globally and accounting for 8 per cent of global production. To bolster this sector, a 
comprehensive intervention has been developed in the form of Pradhan Mantri Matsya 
Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with the objective to enhance seed and fish production and other 
extension services. To address the sector’s infrastructure needs, the Fisheries and Aquaculture 
Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was introduced in 2018-19 with a total fund size of 
₹7.52 Thousand Crore. So far, 121 proposals have been recommended for ₹5.59 Thousand 
Crore as a concessional rate41. 
Cooperative Societies- Empowering farmers by strengthening com-
munities
9.34	 Cooperatives are vital in aggregating produce, enhancing bargaining power, and ensuring 
better market access to small and marginal farmers, thereby preventing exploitation by 
middlemen and traders. This was seen in the case of the dairy cooperative’s movement, which 
focused on small rural producers (those with 1-2 hectares of land holding)42. There is a realisation 
that Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) can be useful vehicles for facilitating the 
convergence of various schemes intended for farmers’ welfare, improving their effectiveness 
and reach through better participation of the small and marginal farmers in development 
programmes. The government approved a scheme in 2023 with the target of setting up PACS 
in the next five years in the Panchayats/Villages yet to be covered.
9.35	 There has also been an increase in the number of single-state and multi-state cooperatives43 
(MSCs). As of March 2024, there are 8.03 lakh single-state and 1614 multistate cooperatives. 
Further, under the Multistate Cooperative Societies Act 2002, three new MSCs - National 
Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), Bhartiya Beej Sahakari Samiti Limited (BBSSL) and 
41  Department of Fisheries

spective State Government and the cooperative societies with objects confined to more than one State are gov-
erned by the central law, namely, the Multi-State Co-operative Societies.

National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL)-have been established at the national level. The 
new cooperatives seek to promote exports, facilitate access to improved seeds under a single 
brand name, and work toward the production, distribution, and marketing of certified and 
authentic organic products. The response to the setting of the three national-level cooperatives 
has been promising both in terms of the acceptance evident from applications received for 
membership and the permissions already received for the export of cereals to several countries.  
As of 31 March 2024, NCEL has received 7,318 applications for membership from 19 States 
& 03 UTs. It has so far got permission for exports of 15.02 LMT non-basmati white rice to 16 
countries, 9.99 LMT broken rice to 07 countries, 50,000 MT sugar to two countries, and 14,184 
MT wheat grain, 5326 MT wheat flour & 15.22 lakh MT maida/semolina to one country. As of 31 
March 2024, BBSSL has received 16,775 applications for membership from 32 States/UTs. As 
of 31 March 2024, 5,154 applications for membership have been received from 26 States/UTs. 
NCOL has launched 11 products- arhar, chana, moong, kabuli chana, masoor, rajma, jaggery 
powder, sugar, besan, daliya, and jowar atta, under the Bharat Organics Brand.
Box IX.6: Initiatives to address scope and functioning of PACS
Several initiatives taken to improve the functioning and scope of work of the PACS include 
the following:
●  With the view to improving efficiency, the PACS/Large Area Multipurpose Societies 
(LAMP) are being linked with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development 
(NABARD) through a single National Software Network. So far, proposals for the 
computerisation of 67009 PACS have been sanctioned across 30 states/UTs, and ₹654 
Crore to the States and ₹141 Crore to NABARD have been released. 
●  A grain storage programme, which will be the world’s largest decentralised storage 
program, is planned in the cooperative sector to ensure food security and reduce wastage. 
Under this scheme, agricultural infrastructure, such as godowns, custom hiring centres, 
processing units, fair price shops, etc., are being created through the convergence of 
various existing schemes of the Government of India at the PACS level. The pilot project 
in 11 PACS of 11 States has been initiated while the construction of godowns in 500 
additional PACS is approved.
●  The scope of work of the PACS has been increased to allow them to function as common 
service centres for better access to e-services, provide LPG distributorship to increase 
employment opportunities and improve the financial strength of the PACS, to convert 
bulk consumer petrol pumps operated by PACS into retail outlets and to give priority for 
new petrol/diesel pump dealership. 
●  PACS will function as Janaushadhdi Kendra and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samridihi 
Kendra, including as drone entrepreneurs. Further, PACS will be eligible as ‘paani 
samiti’ to undertake operations and maintenance work for the piped water supply and 
will be responsible for setting up decentralised solar power plants at the panchayat level.

9.36	 In addition to the above, steps have also been taken to strengthen the governance of the 
cooperatives. The Multistate Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2023, which came into 
effect on 03 August 2023, seeks to enhance transparency and accountability and improve the 
election process in the multistate cooperative societies by supplementing existing legislation 
and incorporating the provisions of the 97th constitutional amendment that addresses several 
aspects such as the appointment of an ombudsman, introduction of concurrent audit, and 
stipulation of criteria of appointment of chief executive officer.

Agriculture Research and Education: Pushing the frontiers of technology
9.37	 Investment in agriculture research and support of enabling policies have contributed 
substantially to food security. It is estimated that for every rupee invested in agricultural 
research (including education), there is a payoff of ₹13.85. In 2022-23, ₹19.65 Thousand Crore 
was spent on agriculture research, equalling 0.43 per cent of the agricultural GVA.44 There 
is a need to further strengthen research given the number of abiotic and biotic pressures the 
agriculture sector faces. 
9.38	 The Indian Council on Agricultural Research (ICAR), is the apex organisation in agriculture 
research in the country. It has worked in diverse areas of research covering crop and seed 
production, bio-fortified varieties of grains and oils, promotion of millets, animal production 
and health, agricultural mechanisation and post-harvest management, and fisheries. Farmers’ 
outreach for agricultural technologies demonstration and skill upgradation are important 
aspects of the work carried out by ICAR. During 2022-23, 347 varieties/hybrids of 44 crops 
were released, and 99 varieties of horticultural crops were notified for commercial cultivation. 
In addition, 27 bio-fortified varieties of rice, wheat, maize, finger millet, mustard, soybean and

groundnut were released. Many of the rice varieties that India now exports to the rest of the 
world came out of research at the International Rice Research Institute. It is a reminder that 
agricultural research offers one of the highest returns on investment. Hence, reinforcing the 
agricultural research ecosystem with human and financial resources will continue to pay rich 
dividends to farmers and to the nation.
FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR (FPI): PROCESSING POTENTIAL
9.39	 India is the largest producer of milk and the second largest producer of fruits, vegetables 
and sugar. The availability of reasonably priced agricultural inputs, the vast labour force, and 
continuously growing consumer demand provide the essential elements for a robust food 
processing industry.  The sector also plays a vital role in reducing the wastage of perishable 
agricultural produce, enhancing the shelf life of food products, ensuring value addition to 
agricultural produce, and incentivises diversification & commercialisation of agriculture. 
True to that, the food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers in organised 
manufacturing, with a 12.02 per cent share in the total employment in the organised sector45. 
The value of agri-food exports, including processed food exports during 2022-23, was USD46.44 
Billion, accounting for about 11.7 per cent of India’s total exports. The share of processed food 
exports also increased from 14.9 per cent in 2017-18 to 23.4 per cent in 2022-23. 
9.40	 It is an important industry because it has strong linkages with the agriculture sector and 
can employ surplus workforce released from the agriculture sector.  During the last eight years 
ending 2022-23, the food processing industries has been growing at an average annual growth 
rate (AAGR) of around 5.35 per cent at 2011-12 prices. Being labour-intensive, the pandemic 
adversely affected the sector and it is now recovering. GVA in the food processing sector 
has increased from ₹1.30 lakh Crore in 2013-14 to ₹1.92 lakh Crore in 2022-23. The sector 
constituted 7.66 per cent of GVA in Manufacturing in 2022-23 at 2011-12 prices.

9.41	 The Government has taken several initiatives to improve the supply chain management 
from farm gates to retail outlets. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the Food 
Processing Industry (PLISFPI) supports the creation of global food manufacturing champions, 
branding and marketing abroad. It is expected to create off-farm employment and provide 
better prices for farm produce and higher income to farmers. Presently, 173 applications are 
covered under the PLI Scheme. The beneficiaries of the scheme have invested ₹7.69 Thousand 
Crore. An incentive amount to the tune of ₹1.07 Thousand Crore was released in FY 2021-22 
and FY 2022-23. 
9.42	 The PM Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) scheme with 
a total outlay of ₹10 Thousand Crore provides credit-linked subsidy and capacity building, 
including marketing and branding support.  Convergence is being sought with the existing 
ecosystem to support and complement other schemes such as the National Rural Livelihood 
Mission, National Urban Livelihood Mission, One District One Product, AIF, and PMKSY 
implementation. All State/UTs have appointed a state nodal agency, constituted state level 
approval committee & district level committee for implementation of the scheme. Further, 
2 national level technical institutes and 44 state level technical institutes in 36 States/ UTs 
have also been approved. Against the target of two lakhs, 3,53,608 applications were received, 
and a loan amount of ₹6.94 Thousand Crore to 86,342 applicants was sanctioned. 522 Master 
Trainers from 35 States/UTs and 1068 District Level Trainers from 26 States/UTs and 70,936 
beneficiaries from 30 States/UTs have been trained.
9.43	 The scheme for developing the Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain was launched 
in 2018-19. The coverage of Operation Green has been expanded from 3 crops (tomato, onion 
& potato) to 22 perishables crops, which include 10 fruits, 11 vegetables (including TOP) and 
one marine, i.e. shrimp. The scheme’s objectives include enhancing farmers’ value realisation, 
reducing post-harvest losses, increasing food processing capacities, and adding value. The 
scheme has two-pronged strategies: Price Stabilization Measures (short-term measures) and 
Integrated Value Chain Development Projects (long-term). Under the short-term interventions 
of the scheme, there is a provision for a 50 per cent subsidy on the cost of transportation and 
storage for fruits & vegetables for evacuation of surplus production from production centres 
during the glut situation. For the long-term, grant-in-aid is provided in the range 35 per cent to 
50 per cent for setting up food processing project for eligible crops in the identified production 
clusters in major producing states.
FOOD MANAGEMENT46: SOCIAL NET FOR FOOD SECURITY
9.44	 The main objectives of food management are the procurement of foodgrains from 
farmers at remunerative prices, the distribution of foodgrains to consumers, particularly to 
the vulnerable sections of society, at affordable prices, and the maintenance of food buffer 
stocks for food security and price stability. The instruments used are procurement at MSP from 
farmers and Central Issue Price (CIP) for consumers. The nodal agency that undertakes the 
procurement, distribution, and storage of food grain is the Food Corporation of India (FCI).

For prudent management of foodgrain stock and for ensuring adequate availability of wheat 
and rice in the central pool, the Central Government implements a decentralized procurement 
scheme. 
9.45	 As of 24 May 2024, procurement of wheat during the Rabi Marketing Season(RMS) 2024-
25 is going smoothly in the major procuring States nationwide, with 263.33 LMT of wheat 
already procured for the central pool, surpassing last year’s total procurement of 262.02 LMT. 
A total of 22.42 lakh farmers have been benefitted during RMS 2024-25. Similarly, 489.20 
LMT of rice was procured directly from 98.26 lakh farmers during the Kharif Marketing Season 
(KMS) 2023-24. With the above procurement quantity, the combined stock of wheat and rice in 
central pool has surpassed 600 LMT, which puts the country in a comfortable position to meet 
its requirements for food grains. 
9.46	 The distribution of food grains is undertaken primarily under the National Food Security 
Act, 2013 (NFSA) and other welfare schemes of the Government of India, including PMGKAY. 
The government has addressed the issue of food security at the household level for a long time 
through the public distribution system and the targeted public distribution system, as well as 
the enactment of the NFSA 2013. Further, the Government decided to continue to provide free 
food grains to about 81.35 crore beneficiaries (i.e., Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households 
and Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries) under the PMGKAY for a further period of five 
years with effect from 01 January 2024, with an estimated total financial outlay of ₹11.80 
lakh Crore to be borne by Central Government. The scheme provides a unified institutional 
mechanism with uniform prices and quantities across the country and removes difficulties for 
beneficiaries, especially migrants, under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC). Through 
this system, migrant beneficiaries can claim from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice, 
anywhere in the country, based on existing/same ration card in a seamless manner by using 
either their ration card or Aadhaar number after biometric/ Aadhaar authentication on ePoS 
device. 
9.47	 The procurement of foodgrains at MSP and distribution of foodgrains at less than 
economic cost have financial implications for the government. The economic cost47 of both 
wheat and rice witnessed a significant increase during the last few years due to an increase in 
MSPs and a proportionate increase in the incidentals.  The economic cost of rice and wheat for 
the year 2023-24(RE) is at ₹ 3931.34 per quintal and ₹ 2709.59 per quintal, respectively48. 
47  The economic cost of foodgrains consists of three components, namely, pooled cost of grains, procurement 
incidentals and the cost of distribution.

CONCLUSION
9.48	 The performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy’s growth and 
has been growing at an average growth rate of 4.18 per cent over the last five years. The growing 
significance of allied sectors such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries in enhancing 
farmers’ income suggests that greater emphasis should be placed on tapping into the potential 
of these activities to boost farmers’ incomes. Smallholder farmers’ incomes cannot be increased 
by producing rice, wheat, or even millets, pulses and oilseeds. They need to move to high-value 
agriculture – fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy and buffalo meat. Once the incomes 
of smallholders increase, they will demand manufactured goods, spurring a manufacturing 
revolution. That is what happened in China between 1978 and 1984 when the real incomes of 
farmers doubled in just 6 years. India is well-placed to emulate this.
9.49	 Promoting crop diversification towards oilseeds, pulses, and horticulture requires 
addressing critical issues such as investment in agri-infrastructure, credit accessibility and 
appropriate market institutions. MSP has incentivised crop diversification and there is evidence 
that MSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on retail prices of all crops, with a 
stronger effect for those crops where procurement is substantial, such as paddy and wheat.49

Efforts must be made to encourage production patterns and practices in various geographies 
that are consistent with their agro-climatic characteristics and natural resources. Research and 
development and promotion of digital technologies in agriculture, as well as improving the 
quality of seeds, including promoting organic and natural farming, can play a significant role 
in the realisation of sustainable agriculture practices that efficiently improve farm income and 
influence farmer behaviour. 
9.50	  Enhancing private sector investment in agriculture is vital to provide impetus to the 
agriculture sector. Investment in technology, production methods, marketing infrastructure, 
and reduction in post-harvest losses need to be scaled up. A greater focus on post-harvest 
infrastructure and the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/loss and 
increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. Productivity of the crop 
sector can also be enhanced through greater investment, including from the private sector. 
9.51	 E-NAM, promoting FPOs, and allowing cooperatives to participate in agri-marketing 
can improve the market infrastructure and allow better price discovery. Improving the market 
infrastructure by incentivising states can be explored. This can be done by creating an index 
to rank states, allowing the participation of cooperatives, and enabling remunerative returns 
to investors according to the functioning of their APMCs and other market institutions. Such a 
competitive framework can drive states to strive for improved agricultural marketing. It is also 
worth considering providing financial incentives for states to undertake necessary interventions 
to modernise agriculture marketing as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission.

INDUSTRY: SMALL AND 
MEDIUM MATTERS
Industrial growth accelerated in FY24, with manufacturing and construction leading 
the way. Industrial GVA at constant prices in FY24 was 25 per cent higher than the 
pre-Covid FY20 levels, affirming broad-based recovery and consolidation. This 
was supported by greater credit offtake, a thrust on capital formation to shore up 
infrastructure-oriented sectors, and a supportive policy framework. 
In the last decade, there were considerable changes in the sectoral composition of India’s 
manufacturing landscape. Some consumer-oriented industries like automobiles, wood 
products, furniture and pharmaceuticals have made large gains in output share and 
production-oriented sectors like machinery, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and 
rubber and plastic products have also had share gains, balancing the growth dynamics. 
At a same time, sectors like petroleum products, textiles, beverage and tobacco have 
witnessed gradual decline in their output share.
Going forward, invigorating ongoing efforts to impart greater efficiencies, skills, and 
dynamics to labour-intensive segments like textiles, food processing, and MSMEs 
would lend greater balance to industrial expansion. Incentivising R&D investment, 
greater formalisation of smaller manufacturers, alleviating their supply chain 
bottlenecks, facilitating market access and improving access to finance will also 
foster industrialisation. Further reduction in the compliance burden for MSMEs will 
considerably improve their growth prospects.
Domestic demand conditions on account of consumption and investment are strong 
and conducive to smooth industrial output expansion in the near term. A forward-
looking survey of the Reserve Bank of India on business expectations and industrial 
outlook presents a positive outlook. However, headwinds persist in terms of uncertain 
global demand conditions and prices of key inputs for which India is import-dependent. 
INTRODUCTION
10.1	
Economic growth of 8.2 per cent in FY24 was supported by an industrial growth of 
9.5 per cent.1 Among the four sub-sectors of industry, manufacturing and construction 
achieved close to double-digit growth, while mining & quarrying and electricity & water supply 
also recorded strong positive growth in FY24. This reflects the broad-based acceleration of 
1   As per the provisional estimates of GDP released by the Central Statistics Office on 30 May 2024. This is greater 
than the 9 per cent industrial growth estimated in the second advance estimates of GDP released in February 
2024, indicating faster than anticipated expansion of industrial output during the latter part of FY24.

industrial output. The HSBC India Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing also 
consistently remained well above the threshold value of 50 in all months of FY24, indicating 
sustained expansion and stability in India's manufacturing sector. 
10.2	
The share of manufacturing in total gross value added at current prices was 14.3 per 
cent in FY23.  However, the output share is 35.2 per cent during the same period, indicating 
that the sector has significant backward and forward linkages that are not fully captured within 
its value-added share. About 47.5 per cent of the total value of output in the country is used as 
inputs in productive activities (inter-industry consumption)2. Manufacturing activities account 
for about 50 per cent of the inter-industry consumption and, at the same time, supply almost 
50 per cent of inputs used in all productive activities (agriculture, industry and services).

Despite the pandemic and consequent impairment of manufacturing value chains, the 
manufacturing sector achieved an average annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent in the last decade. 
The manufacturing sub-sectors witnessed considerable realignment in output shares in the 
last decade. Catalysts of manufacturing growth in the last decade included chemicals, wood 
products and furniture, transport equipment, pharmaceuticals and machinery and equipment. 
Out of them, the expansion of steel, machinery and equipment, wood products, and transport 
equipment signifies a thrust on capital formation in the economy, especially in the public sector.

10.4	
India’s industrialisation was held in check by the absence of physical infrastructure and 
logistics as well as intrusive and cumbersome licensing requirements on capacity creation and 
expansion. Further, the manufacture of specific items was reserved for the small-scale sector. 
Much of these restrictions have been now lifted, and physical infrastructure is being created 
at a rapid pace. Connectivity has improved. The Goods and Services Tax has created a single 
market for several commodities, enabling manufacturing at scale. However, India faces stiff 
challenges in growing its manufacturing base. Public policy must do whatever it can to boost 
competitiveness. Action lies predominantly in deregulation. The private sector must think 
long-term and invest in quality through R&D spending. These may not be sufficient, but they 
are necessary conditions for the growth of the sector. Manufacturing still has the ability to 
generate low and semi-skilled jobs and bring development closer to the people. India needs to 
prioritise the sector.
10.5	
The remaining sections of the Chapter are organised in the following way. The next 
section examines progress, challenges and policy initiatives in different industrial segments, 
such as key industrial intermediates and consumer-oriented industries3. This is followed by a 
brief discussion on cross-cutting themes like production-linked incentives (PLIs), micro, small

and medium enterprises (MSMEs), central public sector undertakings (CPSEs) and industrial 
R&D and innovation. The final section concludes the discussions and provides a wayforward.
PERFORMANCE OF KEY SECTORS AND RELATED ISSUES
Key Industrial Intermediates
Cement: Building the future
10.6	
The cement industry contributes approximately 11 per cent of the input cost to the 
construction sector in India.4 Since de-licensing in 1991, the cement industry has progressed 
significantly both in capacity and process technology, so much so that India is the second largest 
cement producer in the world after China.5
10.7	
The Indian cement industry comprises 159 integrated large cement plants, 120 grinding 
units and 62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry 
in India is about 622 million tonnes, with cement production of around 427 million tonnes in 
FY24. Most of the cement plants in India are located in proximity to the raw material source. 
About 85 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated in the States of Rajasthan, Andhra 
Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar 
Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal.
10.8	
The industry has adequate capacity to meet the domestic cement demand; the quantity 
of cement imported in the year FY23 is about 0.2 per cent of total domestic cement production.  
The export of clinker and other cement increased until FY19 and then started declining except 
for other hydraulic cement on account of lower global demand and increasing competition from 
other countries. In FY23, India exported only a negligible quantity of clinker.

10.9	
The industry has maintained a capacity utilisation rate of approximately 60-65 per cent 
in recent years. Reports also expect that the global demand for cement is likely to be flat during 
2024-2030, with bright spots in demand emanating only from India, Africa, the Middle East 
and North America to an extent. Yet gross margins in the cement industry are likely to be 
robust globally, helped by higher prices and lower fuel costs.6
10.10	 Domestic cement consumption in India is around 260 kg per capita against a global 
average of 540 kg per capita, signifying potential for growth.  In the last ten years, the import of 
clinker has increased. However, the quantity of imports is still low.  
10.11	 The cement industry is mainly driven by robust infrastructure development and 
urbanisation. The government's focus on mega infrastructure projects such as highways, 
railways, housing schemes and smart cities will boost cement demand significantly. The push 
for rural development and increased investment in industrial and commercial construction 
support growth prospects.
10.12	 Globally, the cement sector generates about 7 per cent of the total anthropogenic 
emissions. The Indian cement industry has been working on the issue. Greenhouse gas 
emissions are estimated to have been reduced to 0.56 t CO2 per tonne of cement in 2023. CO2 
emissions are targeted to be further reduced to 0.35 t CO2 per tonne of cement by 2050, as 
estimated in the cement industry technology roadmap.7
Steel sector on the growth path
10.13	 Iron and steel contribute approximately 47 per cent of all inputs in the building & 
construction sector.8 It also serves as a critical input for the production of machinery and 
consumer goods. The steel sector achieved its highest levels of production and consumption 
during FY24.
10.14	 India became a net exporter of finished steel over the past decade. In FY24, India started 
off as a net exporter in Q1. However, in Q2 and Q3, it became a net importer. This was largely 
driven by price differentials between international and domestic prices of finished steel. Low 
prices in the international market led to reduced profit margins for exports and made imports 
more affordable, affecting the trade balance in steel. However, the import dependence on 
coking coal, an essential raw material for steel production went up from 56.1 MT in FY23 to 
58.1 MT in FY24.
10.15	 As the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, green steel is poised to play a pivotal 
role in reshaping the future of the steel industry. India’s steel sector accounts for 12 per cent9 of 
India’s greenhouse gas emissions with an emission intensity of 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of 
crude steel compared to the global average of 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel.

Box X.1: Steel sector initiatives
To achieve the goal of a self-reliant India and boost the steel sector, the Government 
established the Nagarnar Steel plant in Bastar district in October 2023, marking a significant 
milestone in India's steel production capabilities. The greenfield project is expected to 
produce high-quality steel, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region 
and positioning India as a key player in the global steel market. The plant is designed to 
produce a range of flat steel products. In FY24, the plant produced 4.93 Lakh tonnes of hot-
rolled coils. Among the steel CPSEs, Steel Authority of India Limited achieved its best-ever 
production of hot metal, crude steel, and saleable steel in FY24.

Coal: Reducing external dependence 
10.16	 Coal accounts for more than 55 per cent of India’s primary commercial energy. Coal-
fired power generation accounts for about 70 per cent of the total power generation. Coal 
production accelerated in the last five years, leading to reduced import dependence. In FY24, 
India produced 997.2 million tonnes of coal, imported 261 MT and consumed 1233.86 MT10. 
The ratio of domestic production of coal to consumption improved gradually over the last 
decade as the growth in production outstripped the growth in consumption.

•	 Procedural complexities in acquiring 
forestry and environmental clearances, 
land acquisition, and possession need 
to be taken care of for the timely 
development of mining projects.
•	 Need for sustainable solutions amid 
global environmental action.
•	 To mitigate challenges, the industry 
is focusing on reducing emissions, 
improving 
energy 
efficiency, 
and 
adopting cleaner coal technologies. 
•	 In spite of an adequate domestic supply 
of thermal coal, only the substitutable 
part of the import can be replaced. 
Increasing demand for coking coal will 
push coking coal imports up. Coking coal 
beneficiation needs to be scaled up for 
blending with imported coal under the 
‘coking coal mission’. 
•	 Coal can be used as a green energy source, 
such as coal mine methane (CMM), coal 
bed methane (CBM), coal to liquid, and 
coal to methanol. The CMM and CBM 
need to be tapped progressively.

one country. The PLI schemes for bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals have helped stabilize the 
import of bulk drugs and improved our supply chain resilience. Under the scheme, fermentation-
based manufacturing capabilities got strengthened through production of antibiotics such as 
Penicillin G and Clavulanic Acid. The CAGR of import of bulk drugs between FY22 and FY24 
was 2.3 per cent, as compared to the CAGR of 5.9 per cent in their export. India has become

Box X.4: Need to Enhance and Reimagine Pharma R&D 
The pharmaceutical industry worldwide can be divided into an innovator or a generic 
producer. As the name suggests, ‘innovator’ firms carry out extensive research to bring 
new medicines or treatments for diseases to the world. Considering the extent of time and 
resources as also the risk involved in the process, the prices of such medicines are usually very 
high. Such firms thrive on monopolies created through intellectual property rights owned by 
them for these new medicines. In recent years, big innovator pharma companies have made 
a strategic move to invest in smaller, more agile research-oriented firms. Between 2021 and 
2023, the investment amounted to USD 54 billion in small bio-tech firms.16
India’s strength in the pharmaceutical sector lies in being a cost effective and efficient 
producer of existing off patented drugs- also called the generic industry. Even so research 
and development is key to producing the same medicines once they get off patent at a 
fraction of the cost of the original drug. They thrive on competition. The world needs both 
the innovators and those that can provide drugs at a reasonable price, with the latter playing 
a vital role in enhancing social benefits. Hence, the strength of the industry lies in having a 
diverse combination of innovators and generic producers. 
As we move towards realising the vision of Viksit Bharat, it is vital to promote innovation. 
The R&D expenditure in the drugs and pharmaceutical sector in India averaged around 5 
per cent of the sales turnover in FY20 and FY2117. The development of new drugs aimed at 
addressing unaddressed health concerns will improve the breadth and quality of healthcare 
access for the population, while producing better returns on investments.
The report “Indian pharmaceutical sectorial system of innovation”18 underscores the need 
for: 
i)	
fostering joint research amongst industry actors with the aim of making the sector more 
strategically collaborative rather than competitive. 
ii)	 bolstering industry-academic interactions for applied research, in particular better 
participation of public knowledge-based institutions.
iii)	 reducing the rigidity of communication between knowledge-based institutions in 
order to foster better knowledge exchange and collaboration in the areas of research, 
particularly with the inclusion of Tier 2 and Tier 3 institutions. 
iv)	 supporting secondments and placements between knowledge-based institutions and 
industry in order to better orient human capital development. 
v)	 strengthening communication channels amongst the knowledge-based institutions and 
intermediaries, particularly industry associations. 
vi)	 increasing the channels of funding from venture capital and angel investors to support 
the process of ideation to market.

vii)	 better knowledge sharing amongst government bodies to promote an 'all of government 
approach' to innovation thus translating into more coordinated joint research in 
strategic areas. 
The government has taken several measures to create and nurture an ecosystem that 
promotes innovation. This is reflected in the setting up of centres for excellence to promote 
collaborative research in the pharmaceutical sector, and in artificial intelligence including 
for the health sector. The recently introduced Promotion of Research and Innovation in 
Pharma MedTech Sector is expected to herald a transformation in the pharmaceutical sector 
towards innovation.
Textile industry: Navigating challenges
10.21.	 As per the National Accounts published by the Central Statistics Office, textiles, including 
the wearing apparel sector, generated a gross value added of ₹3.77 lakh Crore in FY23, which 
was about 10.6 per cent of the manufacturing GVA at current prices during the year. The sector 
also accounted for 29.3 per cent of the total non-corporate manufacturing GVA and 7.9 per cent 
of the corporate manufacturing GVA in FY23. 
10.22.	India has a robust end-to-end value chain in the textile industry, spanning raw materials 
like natural and MMF fibre to the final product and covering apparel, home textiles, and 
technical textiles. India is the world's second-largest clothing manufacturer and one of the 
top five exporting nations. In FY24, the export of textiles and apparel, including handicrafts,

Box X.5: Challenges and supportive initiatives in the textile industry
Industry context and challenges
Supportive initiatives
•	 The majority of India's textile and apparel 
production capacity is on account of 
MSMEs, which account for over 80 per 
cent of the sector, and the average scale 
of operations is relatively small. Thus, 
efficiency and economies of scale from 
large-scale modern manufacturing are 
limited.
•	  The fragmented nature of India's apparel 
sector, with raw materials sourced 
predominantly 
from 
Maharashtra, 
Gujarat, 
and 
Tamil 
Nadu, 
while 
spinning capacities are concentrated in 
southern states, contributes to higher 
transportation costs and delays. 
•	 Other factors, such as India's heavy 
dependence on imported machinery, 
except 
in 
the 
spinning 
segment, 
inadequate 
availability 
of 
skilled 
manpower, technological obsolescence, 
etc, also act as significant constraints.  
•	 Seven PM MITRA Parks, with a budget 
of ₹4,445 Crore, will be established from 
FY22 to FY28 in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, 
Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, 
Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra. 
•	 The 
parks 
will 
feature 
1,000-acre 
industrial infrastructure and "plug and 
play" facilities. 
•	 MoUs were signed with all seven states, 
with JVs and SPVs established in five 
states.
•	 The Government approved a PLI Scheme 
with ₹10,683 Crores over five years for 
man-made fibre apparel and fabrics and 
technical textiles. It is expected to attract 
over ₹19,000 Crore in investment and 
create 2.5 Lakh jobs.
•	 Launched with an outlay of ₹1,480 Crore 
for FY21 to FY24, the National Technical 
Textiles Mission focuses on increasing 
the use of technical textiles in various 
sectors. 
•	 NITI 
Aayog's 
recommendations 
for 
the sector include supporting domestic 
machine 
manufacturers 
through 
initiatives such as ATUFS, fostering 
R&D, and promoting innovation.
•	 Priorities also include creating world-
class textile infrastructure with plug-
and-play 
facilities. 
The 
focus 
will 
also be on technological upgradation, 
sustainability and circularity, quality and 
standards and promotion of handloom 
and handicraft products.
•	 It 
has 
four 
components: 
research 
innovation & development, promotion 
and market development, education, 
training 
and 
skilling, 
and 
export 
promotion. It has been extended to 
March 2026, with a sunset clause until 
March 2028.
•	 137 research projects for ₹474 Crore have 
been approved so far.
•	 The National Handloom Development 
Programme (NHDP) approved for FY22 
to FY26 with an outlay of ₹998 Crore.
•	 In FY24, initiatives were undertaken to 
establish 96 small handloom clusters. 
Nine mega handloom clusters have also 
been set up.

10.24.	Research by the Centre for Development Studies19 shows that India has seen a significant 
increase in domestic value addition (DVA), employment, wages and salaries in mobile 
manufacturing segment since FY17. The share of DVA in mobile phone output rose from an 
average of 8.7 per cent in FY17 to FY19 (Phase 1) to 22 per cent in FY20 to FY22 (Phase 2), 
indicating considerable increase in local participation. While the DVA as a ratio of exports may 
be low, participating in global value chains (GVC) increases in overall value added because 
of economies of scale in manufacturing for the vast global market. The direct workforce in 
the production of mobile phones has more than tripled between FY17 to FY22, particularly 
benefiting female blue-collar workers. Wages and salaries increased by 317 per cent between 
phase 1 and phase 2. The study suggests that reducing service link costs is crucial for seamless 
participation in GVC, necessitating efforts to lower transaction costs. This recommends a 
comprehensive policy approach, including low import tariffs for intermediate inputs, to 
replicate success in other sectors.

Box X.6: Initiatives to Boost Electronics Industry
The Indian government places a high priority on electronics hardware manufacturing, 
which is a key aspect of both the "Make in India" and "Digital India" initiatives. In order 
to attract and encourage significant investments in the electronics value chain and boost 
exports, the government has introduced several schemes: (i) Production Linked Incentive 
Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, (ii) PLI IT Hardware, (iii) Scheme 
for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), 
and (iv) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0). These schemes have been 
instrumental in driving growth in the country's electronics sector. As a result, the CAGR in 
the production of electronics goods from FY18 to FY23 was 16.19 per cent, while the exports 
increased by 35.7 percent in the same period.
To bolster the electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country, the Scheme for 
Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) was 
introduced in 2020. The scheme offers a substantial financial incentive of 25 per cent on 
capital expenditure for a specific list of electronic goods that form the downstream value 
chain of electronic products. As of March 2024, a proposed investment of ₹12,638 Crore and 
committed incentives of ₹1758 Crore have been approved under the Scheme. 
PLI 2.0 for IT Hardware 
Electronics Manufacturing Clusters 
(EMC/EMC 2.0) Scheme
 Notified in May 2023, the Scheme aims to 
broaden and deepen the manufacturing 
ecosystem by encouraging localisation 
of components and sub-assemblies tied 
to incremental sales and investment 
thresholds.
 The Scheme offers an average incentive 
of around 5 per cent on net incremental 
sales of eligible goods manufactured in 
India for six years.
 Progress of the Scheme: 
Total production: ₹3367.63 Crore
Additional investment: ₹269.44 Crore
Additional direct jobs: 3493
 The EMC Scheme, launched in 2012, 
supports EMC projects and Common 
Facility Centres to attract electronics 
manufacturing in India. 
 The EMC 2.0 Scheme, notified in April 
2020, extends financial assistance for the 
above projects, with applications open 
until March 2024 and disbursement 
until March 2028.
 Progress of Scheme: ₹184.91 Crore has 
been released under the scheme and is 
expected to attract ₹40,429 Crore in 
investment and generate employment 
for 5.02 Lakh.

Automotive industry
10.25.	 The Indian automobile industry includes major global auto manufacturers across 
different categories, as well as a vibrant auto component industry that produces various auto 
parts, body and chassis. The growth in the value of domestic production and consumption of 
automotive parts moderated during FY20 to FY23, compared to the previous five years. The 
production of auto components depends on the dynamics of the domestic and export markets. 
The auto components sector closely follows the trends in automobile production. As seen 
below, the pandemic affected the automobile sector considerably, which weakened the demand 
for automotive parts and, hence, their pace of expansion.

infrastructural bottlenecks, and skilling. To address these challenges, the Government has 
implemented initiatives and platforms aimed at supporting formalisation, ease of registration 
and grievance redressal, like the Samadhaan Portal, Sambandh Portal, and Champions 
Portal, which aid in delayed payment issues, procurement monitoring, and speedy resolution

of grievances. The Global Value Chain Development Report (2019) highlights that although 
SMEs are underrepresented in global value chains, the digital economy offers them significant 
new opportunities. This is evident in India's MSME sector, where nearly 70 per cent of total 
e-commerce sales in 2020-21 were from MSMEs, reflecting a year-on-year growth rate of 60-
70 per cent21. Further, research shows that reimagining the level of regulations on the usage of 
factory space, like those relating to setbacks, will likely augment the manufacturing capacity, 
especially of the micro and small firms (Box X.9).
Box X.9: Reimagining building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity
Existing industrial building regulations limit factory land usage, reducing land utility and 
resulting in unquantified costs. The report titled State of Regulation: Building Standards 
Reforms for Jobs and Growth22 illustrates how land remains unutilised while complying 
with the four building regulations relating to ground coverage, setbacks, parking and floor 
area ratio.  
	1.	 Land lost due to Ground Coverage: The report shows that under the ground 
coverage regulations on factory plots, intended to control density and promote 
groundwater recharge, a factory building can cover no more than 40–60 per cent 
of the plot, depending on the State in which the factory conducts its operations. In 
comparison, in Hong Kong, a factory will not lose any proportion of the plot; in the 
Philippines, only 30 per cent of the plot.
	2.	 Land lost due to Setbacks: State-level regulations limit the horizontal building 
expansion to minimise fire risk and ensure ventilation and light. The aforementioned 
report shows that regulations, however, do not account for modernisation in technology 
and manufacturing processes. For example, the use of fire-resistant materials and 
automatic fire-fighting equipment can effectively reduce hazards without locking up 
productive land. Moreover, natural light and ventilation may be counterproductive 
in certain industries like chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Setbacks are 
particularly challenging for micro and small factories in certain States. The factories 
end up losing even 60–90 per cent of their land in certain States just to comply with 
these regulations. A mega factory in an Indian State loses ~2X more land to setbacks 
than one in the Philippines and ~5X more than the one in Singapore.
	3.	 Land lost due to Parking Regulations: State governments enforce regulations 
mandating off-street parking to ease street congestion. However, research suggests 
that these mandates may actually contribute to more congestion. Parking requirements 
do not align with actual demand, leading factories to lose a significant amount of land. 
The report finds that the factories across India lose ~12–70 per cent of their land to

     meet parking minimums. A factory in India may have to provide at least double the 
number of car parking spaces compared to Hong Kong, the Philippines, or Singapore.
	4.	 Land lost due to Floor Ratio: States regulate the floor area ratio (FAR) to restrict 
vertical expansion on designated land parcels, aiming to manage density, alleviate 
traffic congestion, and facilitate the provision of essential utilities such as water and 
electricity. However, such regulations may inadvertently contribute to urban sprawl, 
thereby exacerbating road congestion and escalating utility provisioning expenses. On 
average, factories across states are only allowed to create floor space up to 1.3 times the 
plot size. With a 1000 sqm plot, an office building in Mumbai can be built up to 5000 
sqm, whereas in Japan, it can go up to 13,000 sqm and 15,000 sqm in Singapore and 
Hong Kong. 
There is a need to examine and rationalise building regulations to augment manufacturing 
capacity. Better utilisation of land will bring the fixed cost of production per unit, 
thus incentivising the entrepreneur to hire more workers as well. Apart from studying 
international best practices, inter-state comparisons can help states identify best practices 
and adopt appropriate policies.
Box X.10: ODOP: Crafting regional pride and economic empowerment
In 2018, the Government launched the One District One Product (ODOP) initiative to identify, 
brand, and promote the unique strengths of each district through a single, iconic product 
produced in that district to bridge the regional economic divide and nurture self-reliance 
across India's diverse districts. Districts that have more than one product identified have 
been categorised as secondary or tertiary products. These products cover various sectors, 
including agriculture, manufacturing, handloom and textiles, handicrafts, food processing, 
marine, and services. The initiative has identified 1102 products from 761 districts across 
the country till now. 
To give an impetus to the ODOP initiative, the Union Budget of FY24 announced that States 
would be encouraged to set up a “Unity Mall” in their state capital or most prominent tourism 
centre or the financial capital for the promotion and sale of their own ODOPs, GI products 
and other handicraft products, and for providing space for such products of all other states. 
These “PM-Ekta Malls” aim to link the artisans of ODOP and consumers. These malls are 
creating a vibrant marketplace for the nation’s unique products, aiming at both domestic 
and foreign markets. 
The Government has been undertaking many initiatives to promote ODOP and showcase 
success stories. ‘ODOP Sampark’ workshops were conducted in 15 States to facilitate 
collaboration between the Centre and local sellers and revive indigenous industries. ODOP 
showcased India to the world at the various G20 events organised across the country during 
India’s G20 Presidency, where the artisans, sellers and weavers got much visibility on the 
global stage during the events.23

Some of the success stories of ODOP
•	 Pack sheds and irrigation arteries, funded by various Government initiatives, have 
resulted in a 20 per cent surge in the production of Shopian apples in Kashmir. 
•	 NGOs, local administration, and over 700 farmers in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand 
have been empowered with organic farming skills through 15 tailored training sessions.  
Equipped with vital tools for 1000+ beneficiaries, red rice production in this district 
increased considerably.
•	 Nearly 1,50,000 tribal families in Araku Valley, Andhra Pradesh, have boosted coffee 
output by 20 per cent, fuelled by Girijan Co-Operative Corporation loans.
•	 Over 5,000 trained workers in the Kandhamal district of Odisha have joined 1,300 farmers 
in garnering domestic and international turmeric markets. Government procurement of 
the spice has also increased by about 70 per cent. Speedy testing labs, financial aid in the 
form of subsidies, loans, and support for formalisation in the Bhatinda district of Punjab 
have led to a 30 per cent rise in honey production.24 
Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)
10.34.	As of March 31, 2023, 254 CPSEs were operational. Around 66 per cent of the CPSEs 
operated in the service sector; the rest in manufacturing, processing & generation and mining 
& exploration. CPSEs achieved stronger financial parameters FY23 and FY24. The total Market 
Capitalisation (M-cap) of 63 CPSEs traded on stock exchanges of India was ₹16.69 Lakh Crore 
as of March 31, 2023, as against ₹15.46 Lakh Crore as of March 31, 2022, reflecting an increase 
of 7.95 per cent25. The overall net profit of operating CPSEs in FY23 was ₹2.12 Lakh Crore. The

Industrial Credit
10.35.	 Industrial credit growth depends on a host of factors, including the cyclicality of economic 
activity, relativity in the availability and cost of bank funds and other market options, the 
position of own resources of industrial enterprises and the banking system’s own risk appetite. 
Recovering from the pandemic-driven moderation in FY21, industrial credit picked up strongly 
in the next year. In FY23, credit growth was mainly driven by large industries; however, this 
growth was hampered by a decrease in credit to certain sectors.

Industrial R&D and Innovation
10.36.	As the public sector presence in core manufacturing is limited to only about 7 per cent, 
its share in industrial R&D is also limited. An initial review of the Global Innovation Index 
(GII) 2023 indicator shows that the U.S. is leading in corporate R&D, followed by China and 
Germany. Middle-income countries like India, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia also experienced 
an increase in their R&D26. As industrial R&D in India is highly concentrated in a few sectors, 
the top five sectors account for more than 70 per cent.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
10.38.	The foregoing analysis gives an indication of the emerging trends in the Indian 
industrial landscape. First, over the last decade, there has been a significant realignment of 
output shares among industrial segments. Sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, 
pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, steel and machinery and equipment have gained in 
strength. Some of these are important industrial intermediates and consumer goods, while 
the others cater to requirements of capital formation. On the other hand, sectors like textiles, 
food products, beverages and tobacco and petroleum products and leather lost their relative 
positions. 
10.39.	Secondly, the export-import balance of different industrial segments has vastly varied 
over the last few years. Consistently, major net exporters include industries such as steel, 
pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. On the other hand, import dependency in key sectors like 
coal, capital goods and chemicals continue.
10.40.	Thirdly, the medium-term outlook on the demand for capital goods and key construction 
inputs like steel and cement is likely to be positive, as there are clear signs that capital formation 
in the private sector is gathering momentum. Global uncertainties raise question mark on 
export demand and the domestic cost of production due to dependence on critical imported 
inputs like coal, petroleum, steel and machinery.

Economic Survey 2023-24
374
10.41.	 Government has taken many recent initiatives to improve ease of doing business, reduce 
compliance burden and to alleviate logistic and infrastructural bottlenecks. The PLI schemes for 
key sectors have attracted significant investments, boosted production, sales and exports and 
generated jobs, particularly in the case of white goods. Where governments across the country 
can help is in reviewing, amending, relaxing and annulling regulations that are messy, stifling, 
counterproductive and raise the cost of operations for businesses without commensurate public 
benefits. Decisions that are best left to the entrepreneurs are mandated by law, leading to fear 
of prosecution. The path to further industrialisation in India is paved with deregulation. 
10.42.	Two common requirements across industries relate to incentivising R&D and innovation 
and improving the skill levels of the workforce. With respect to both, industry must take the 
lead. Commitment to R&D must be in the DNA of the industry, independent of any fiscal 
incentive, since it is about global competitiveness and profitability. With active collaboration 
between industry and academia and emphasis on vocational education in curriculums, India 
can meet the skill shortage more effectively than hitherto.
10.43.	Sectors with widely scattered production units like textiles, and the MSME sector 
in general, seek solutions to constraints of supply chain management, market access and 
formalisation. There have been many focused policy initiatives addressing these issues, as 
mentioned in the section on MSME; further action along the following lines may be considered 
at the levels of the appropriate governments in a cooperative federalism mode:
(a)	 Ensuring support systems to develop MSME projects and their bankability and adequate 
financing arrangements for such projects 
(b)	 targeted facilitation and incentivisation of employment-intensive MSME segments
(c)	 progressively easing the compliance requirements with a single-window mechanism for 
clearances, digitisation of processes and equipping MSMEs to handle these processes 
with ease
(d)	 providing grassroots-level facilitation to ensure market access to MSME products
(e)	 government-industry-academia collaboration to upskill the workforce.
10.44.	Upgrading the statistics on industry on the following lines will aid policymaking:
(a)	 Updated index of industrial production, incorporating the vast changes that have 
occurred in India’s manufacturing landscape. State level variants of such indices will 
help understanding the emerging geographical patterns 
(b)	 Regular indicators of the dynamics of production and employment in MSMEs
(c)	 Information on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as opposed to the 
data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly gross financial 
flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes as well as other financing 
sources.

SERVICES: FUELLING 
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
Through the vicissitudes of the last three decades, the services sector stood as the bulwark 
of India's economic growth. Its post-pandemic dynamics, particularly the trends and 
patterns that emerged and solidified during FY24, indicate an ongoing transformation 
in domestic service delivery systems and their demands. Aided by the focus on policy 
and procedural reforms, physical infrastructure and logistics, all significant business, 
personal, financial and infrastructure-based services have emerged strongly from the 
pandemic. However, the transformation lies in the fast-paced shift towards digital 
services like online payments, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms, as well as the 
increase in the demand for high-tech services as inputs in other productive activities. 
India's young and tech-savvy population offers an opportunity to enhance the country's 
vocational and educational ecosystem further. This will equip the labour force with the 
required digital and high-tech skills in a time-bound manner, helping India reap the 
full dividends of these opportunities.
INTRODUCTION
11.1	
India's services sector encompasses a wide array of economic activities, which can be 
broadly classified into two categories: contact-intensive and non-contact-intensive services. 
The former includes trade, hospitality, transport, real estate, social, community and personal 
services. The latter comprises financial, information technology, professional, communication, 
broadcasting, and storage services. The sector also incorporates public administration and 
defence services. 
11.2	
The services sector continues to be a significant contributor to India's growth, accounting 
for about 55 per cent of the total size of the economy in FY24. Several demand and supply side 
factors determine the performance of the services sector. The significant domestic demand 
for services such as education, healthcare, finance, tourism, hospitality, and entertainment is 
underpinned by a large and young population. Rapid urbanisation supports transportation, 
housing, sanitation, and utility services. The expansion of e-commerce platforms has generated 
heightened requirements for logistics, digital payments, and related services. Information 
technology and business services will likely retain their prominent international presence in 
the medium term. However, studies suggest that the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
is likely to restrain the growth opportunities for business services progressively and, therefore, 
poses a challenge to long-term sustainability and job creation. Thus, focusing on human capital

to take advantage of the agglomeration effects of large, well-functioning cities is critical for the 
growth of services, especially those with global market potential.1
11.3	
The Government has played a crucial role in fostering the growth and competitiveness of 
India's services sector by creating an enabling environment, promoting investment, enhancing 
skills, and facilitating market access. For instance, the Digital India campaign has fostered 
growth in digital services, export promotion schemes have encouraged services exports, 
infrastructure development has boosted logistics, tourism, and hospitality industry, and skill 
development initiatives have provided increased opportunities for the workforce. Furthermore, 
targeted efforts in healthcare and tourism have enhanced accessibility and development, 
ensuring a promising future for India's services sector.
11.4	
The remaining sections of the chapter are organised with the emerging services 
landscape in the country as outlined above in view. The following section provides an overview 
of the performance of the services sectors in terms of domestic output and international trade 
activity, followed by a section on financial flows into the services sector. This is followed by a 
deep dive into the performance of various services sub-sectors and related policy initiatives. 
It may be noted that the developments in important social services like education and health 
are dealt with in Chapter 7 of this Survey. The last two sections highlight the challenges and 
opportunities in the services sector and concludes with a future outlook.
OVERVIEW OF THE SERVICES SECTOR PERFORMANCE 
Gross Value Added (GVA) in the services sector
11.5	
The services sector witnessed a real growth rate of more than 6 per cent in all the years 
in the last decade except in the pandemic-affected FY21. Globally, India’s services exports 
constituted 4.4 per cent of the world's commercial services exports in 2022.

The contribution of the services sector to the overall GVA has increased significantly in 
the last decade. The sector's share dropped in FY21 due to the pandemic-induced contraction. 
However, as shown in Chart XI.3, the sector’s share has almost recovered to the pre-COVID levels.

11.7	
For a decade before COVID, the services sector's real growth rate consistently exceeded 
the overall economic growth. However, in FY21, the services sector saw a sharper contraction of 
8.4 per cent compared to a 4.1 per cent decline in overall GVA. Non-contact intensive services, 
primarily financial, information technology and professional services, experienced positive 
and steady growth due to fewer disruptions and increased demand for digital services. The 
contraction was concentrated in contact-intensive services due to lockdowns, restricted travel, 
and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services due to preventive 
measures. As the restrictions were lifted, these sectors rebounded, aided by the supportive 
policy environment. Hence, post-COVID, the services sector's growth outpaced overall GVA 
growth in FY23 and FY24, reclaiming its role in driving the economy's upward trajectory.

As per the Provisional Estimates, the services sector is estimated to have grown 7.6 per 
cent in FY24. Various high-frequency indicators support the services sector’s growth story. 
Both GST collections and the issuance of e-way bills, reflecting wholesale and retail trade, 
demonstrated a double-digit growth. The gross GST collection reached ₹20.18 lakh crore2  in 
FY24, marking 11.7 per cent increase from the previous year, underscoring robust domestic 
trading activity. Average daily electronic toll collection, total air passengers handled, and rail 
freight traffic registered a YoY growth of 18.9 per cent, 15 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively, 
in FY24, supporting the steady growth of transportation services. However, there is some 
catching up left to be achieved in the pre pandemic trend in the levels of trade, hotel and 
transport sector, as pointed out in Box I.1 of Chapter 1 of this Survey. Bank credit and deposits 
expanded YoY by 20.2 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively, as of March 2024, suggesting 
continued buoyancy in financial services. The residential property market also demonstrated 
a promising trend in 2023, with demand and new supply experiencing double-digit growth.3
Box XI.1: The services sector continues to command the highest share in the 
number of registered companies
A total number of 16,91,495 active companies exist in India as of 31 March 2024. The services 
sector has the highest number of active companies (65 per cent). Within the services sector,

A major factor driving interest in the services sector is the rising share of digitally delivered 
services, which have seen exponential growth in global exports. The rapid formalisation 
of the services sector, increased demand for digital, financial, and entertainment services, 
integration into the global supply chain, and the availability of skilled professionals for start-
ups are driving the sector's growth in the economy.
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)- Services 
11.9	
Business activity in the services sector in India transcended the obstacles of the pandemic 
and other disruptions worldwide. The sector picked up significantly from April 2023 and 
remained resilient throughout the financial year. HSBC’s India Services Purchasing Managers’ 
Index (PMI)5 is a widely used high-frequency indicator that supports the overall services sector 
growth narrative. In March 2024, services PMI soared to 61.2, marking one of the sector's 
most significant sales and business activity expansions in nearly 14 years.  This was primarily 
attributed to the latest upturn in business activity due to healthy demand conditions, efficiency 
gains and positive sales developments. PMI services averaged 60.3 in FY24 for the entire year 
compared to 57.3 in FY23.6 As can be seen from Chart XI.6, the services PMI has remained 
above 50 since August 2021, implying continuous expansion for the last 35 months. The sector 
has continued to expand amidst dynamic market conditions.

Trade in the services sector
11.10	 Over the past three decades, India's export of services has seen remarkable growth, 
surpassing that of merchandise goods exports and constituting a significant portion of global 
exports. Post-pandemic, services exports have maintained a steady momentum and accounted 
for 44 per cent of India’s total exports in FY24. 
11.11	 The weakening of global trade weighed down India’s services exports during FY24, with 
a deceleration in growth to 4.8 per cent from 27.8 per cent a year ago. However, India ranked 
fifth7 in services exports, with other countries being the European Union (excluding intra-EU 
trade), the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Computer services and business 
services exports accounted for about 73 per cent of India’s services exports and witnessed a 9.6 
per cent growth YoY in FY24. The export of travel services experienced a significant growth 
of 24.6 per cent YoY, benefitting from the continued recovery in tourism post-pandemic 
restrictions. On the contrary, transportation receipts declined by 19.1 per cent, primarily 
induced by a decrease in global freight rates, also reflected by a decline in the average Baltic 
Dry Index.8, which decreased by 3.9 per cent on a YoY basis during FY24.

Centres (GCCs) by multinational corporations seeking efficiency gains and reduced business 
costs has significantly boosted software and business services exports. Over the years, the 
share of travel and business services has increased while transportation has marginally fallen. 
Furthermore, the pandemic has catalysed a structural shift in global demand towards digitally 
delivered services. Consequently, India's share in digitally delivered services exports globally 
increased to 6.0 per cent in 2023 from 4.4 per cent in 2019.9
11.13	 During FY24, services imports stood at USD 178.3 billion, a 2.1 per cent decrease on 
a YoY basis, dragged down by a reduction of global freight rates. The rise in services exports, 
coupled with a fall in imports, led to an increase in net services receipts on a YoY basis during 
FY24, which helped cushion India’s current account deficit.
FINANCING SOURCES FOR SERVICES SECTOR ACTIVITY 
11.14	 The services sector fulfils its financing needs domestically through credit from domestic 
banks and capital markets and internationally through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and 
External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). The following section explores in detail how the 
services sector secures its financing.
Bank credit 
11.15	 FY24 witnessed an upward trajectory of credit inflow in the services sector, with YoY 
growth rates surpassing the 20 per cent mark each month since April 2023. The financial year 
ended with an outstanding services sector credit of ₹45.9 lakh crore in March 2024, with a YoY 
growth of 22.9 per cent.10

11.16	 Credit to the services sector flowed across sub-sectors like transport operators, tourism, 
hotels and restaurants, aviation, professional services, trade, and commercial real estate. 
The aviation sector experienced the most significant credit inflow YoY growth of 56 per cent, 
attributed to increased aircraft leasing, hiring and a positive medium to long-term growth outlook. 
External Financing 
11.17	 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published 
the World Investment Report 2024 (WIR 2024) and has ranked India 15th in terms of FDI 
inflow (top 20 host economies) for the year 2023. As per the WIR 2024, India is the 2nd largest 
host country in terms of number of international project finance deals and 4th largest in terms 
of number of Greenfield project announcements.11
11.18	 FY24 witnessed a decline in the FDI equity inflows to the services sector (Chart XI.9), as 
in the case of the overall FDI equity inflows to India. Higher interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, 
heightened global uncertainties and rising protectionism that favour domestic sourcing have 
all contributed to lower FDI inflows into the sector.

a broad spectrum, ranging from passenger transport via trains, buses, taxis, and airlines to 
freight transport facilitated by shipping companies, freight forwarders, and courier services. 
Ancillary services such as vehicle maintenance and airport ground handling further complement 
these transportation offerings. Logistics services are crucial in optimising supply chains. The 
following sections shed light on services offered in roadways, railways, waterways and airways. 
It may be noted that the progress in the build-up of physical infrastructure in these sectors is 
covered in Chapter 12 and not repeated here. 
Roadways
11.21	 A considerable portion of India's cargo is transported via road. Accordingly, improving 
user convenience on National Highways (NH) is pivotal to enhancing overall NH quality. Toll 
digitisation has drastically reduced waiting times at toll plazas, from 734 seconds in 2014 to 47 
seconds in 2024. Initiatives like free flow tolling through Automatic Number Plate Recognition 
and the Global Navigation Satellite System will enhance tolling efficiency in the future. Ministry 
of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has also devised a comprehensive '4E' strategy - 
Engineering (roads and vehicles), Enforcement, Emergency Care, and Education - to elevate 
road safety standards on NHs. The Government has utilised the PM Gati Shakti National Master 
Plan portal for network planning and congestion projections, leveraging big data from e-waybills 
and FASTag to estimate future transportation demand and enhance logistics efficiency. The 
focus on development of access controlled high-speed corridors has impacted the quality of 
NH network. The development of expressways and economic corridors is reducing travel time 
significantly, thereby spurring economic development.13 The exceptional improvements in the 
development of highways are detailed in the section on Road Transport in Chapter 12.
11.22	 Roadway services in India face challenges such as continuous ribbon development 
along highways, slow onboarding of digital land records and long clearance cycles, leading to 
delays in project execution. However, the Government is proactively addressing these issues 
by focusing on developing access-controlled national highways and upgrading existing ones. 
Implementing single-window clearances is crucial for enhancing roadway services' efficiency 
and effectiveness in India's transportation network. Addressing these challenges will help 
realise the full potential of road infrastructure. 
Indian Railways 
11.23	 Indian Railways (IR) hosts many services to enhance user experience, efficiently 
manage the train system and build capacity for a Viksit Bharat. Passenger traffic originating 
in IR was 673 crore in FY24 (provisional actuals), increasing by about 5.2 per cent compared 
to the previous year. IR carried 158.8 crore tonnes of revenue-earning freight in FY24 
(excluding Konkan Railway Corporation Limited), showing an increase of 5.3 per cent over 
the previous year. The freight loadings of the railways achieved CAGR of 7.1 per cent from 
FY20 to FY24, with the special emphasis on capacity addition, new rolling stock and improving 
operational efficiencies. Further details on IR are mentioned in the section on Rail Transport in 
Chapter 12.

Railways.
11.24	 To upgrade the passenger experience, railways have introduced Wi-Fi facilities at 6108 
stations, bridging the digital divide between rural and urban citizens. Indian Railway Catering 
and Tourism Corporation’s (IRCTC) online ticketing system has emerged as one of the largest 
e-commerce websites in the country and Asia Pacific, and it is easily accessible through the 
website, mobile app, and IRCTC authorized agents. The Freight Operations Information System 
comprehensively manages all facets of freight operations, encompassing booking, electronic 
demand registration, transfer of railway receipts, and consignment tracking. The Rail Sugam 
App and Freight Business Development Portal have also been created to enhance customer 
convenience.
11.25	 IR’s train management system offers a comprehensive view of trains running with 
real-time train IDs. It contributes to train punctuality through improved planning and swift 
responses to emergencies. Maintenance of locomotives, coaches, and wagons has been digitised 
by applications such as Locomotive Asset Management, Coaching Management System, and 
Freight Wagon Management System software. The finance system of railways is Information 
Technology (IT) enabled. Bill passing is entirely electronic, with 99.9 per cent of expenditure and 
more than 90 per cent of revenue transactions being cashless. IR has digitised its procurement 
through a comprehensive IT system for material management known as the Indian Railways 
e-Procurement System and Integrated Material Management System. Railway’s Human 
Resource Management System provides fully automated and centralised payroll, pensions, 
employee self-service, performance appraisal, pass, eService record, provident fund, etc.
11.26	 To build capacity, IR has introduced eight centralised training institutes for its personnel 
in diverse fields. About 6.5 lakh railway officials have undergone training in FY24. Railways has 
also developed railway-specific learning content on the iGOT Karmayogi platform, where over 
80 per cent of its officials are onboarded, and 12 per cent are currently enrolled in at least one 
course.

385
Ports, Waterways and Shipping
11.27	 Increased decentralisation of decision-making, integration of professional expertise, and 
adoption of public-private partnership models have improved effectiveness and strengthened 
the management of ports. The port sector is leveraging the Sagar Setu application to streamline 
daily vessel and cargo operations, aspiring to become a central hub for all maritime engagements. 
Sagar Setu is also integrated with all the 13 major ports of India, along with 22 non-major ports 
and 28 private terminals. 
11.28	 There is a push for promoting river cruise tourism on national waterways. The 
development aimed at cargo ships also benefits tourist vessels, as improved waterways and 
facilities enhance their operations. Consequently, there has been a staggering 100 per cent 
surge in overnight cruise trips during FY24. Lighthouses are also emerging as significant 
tourist attractions. To attract visitors, development works such as museums, amphitheatres, 
and cafeterias at 75 lighthouses have been undertaken.

Airways
11.29	 India is the third-largest domestic aviation market and one of the fastest-growing major 
aviation markets globally. The aviation sector in India has shown substantial growth, with a 15 
per cent YoY increase in total air passengers handled at Indian airports reaching 37.6 crore in 
FY24.
11.30	 In FY24, the domestic air passenger traffic handled increased by 13 per cent YoY to 30.6 
crore, and international air passenger traffic handled increased by 22 per cent YoY to 7 crore. 
The growth in international traffic was higher than domestic traffic due to the lower recovery of 
international connectivity in FY23 from the COVID-19 impact. As against a 98 per cent recovery 
in FY23 for domestic passenger traffic, the international recovery was 86 per cent compared to 
pre-COVID levels. Air cargo handled at Indian airports increased by 7 per cent YoY to 33.7 lakh 
tonnes in FY24.
11.31	 The civil aviation sector in India has tremendous potential owing to growing demand, 
increased economic activity, tourism, higher disposable incomes, favourable demographics, and

greater penetration of aviation infrastructure. Progressive government policies further support 
this growth momentum. The Government has approved 21 greenfield airports nationwide and 
operationalised new terminal buildings to increase passenger handling capacity backed by a 
solid capex plan. To promote regional equity, the ‘Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik’ (UDAN) scheme14 
launched in 2016 facilitated the travel of over 141 lakh domestic passengers across various 
579 Regional Connectivity Scheme routes connecting 85 unreserved and underserved airports 
since its inception.

11.32	 Initiatives like Digi Yatra15 are enhancing efficiency through technology. Since its launch, 
more than 2.5 core passengers have benefited from this program. It is to be implemented at all 
airports in a phased manner. 
11.33	 The future of aviation services in India is anchored in the growth of the Maintenance, 
Repair, and Operations sector and the burgeoning drone industry. India aims to become a 
global drone hub by 2030, supported by liberalised regulations and incentives. Recent progress 
includes increased training organisations, remote pilot certificates, registered drones, and 
approved drone models. The promotion of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) 
at GIFT City has facilitated aviation leasing and financing, exemplified by Air India's recent 
aircraft acquisition. As of 31 March 2024, 27 entities have registered for the aircraft leasing 
business, and have leased more than 20 aircrafts, indicating the sector's promising outlook.
11.34	 Economic growth necessitates the growth of the aviation industry and the need for 
expanded airport capacity, which, in turn, brings up sustainability concerns and the need for 
more skilled workers. As per the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, there are approximately 
10,000 pilots with various airlines in India.16 Indian aviation sector stands out positively, with 
women constituting 15 per cent of the country’s pilots, which is almost three times higher than 
14   The objective of UDAN scheme is to connect small and medium cities with big cities through air service. Under 
the UDAN scheme, the airfare for a one-hour journey by a 'fixed wing aircraft' or half an hour's journey by a 
helicopter for about 500 km, has been fixed at (indexed to) ₹4000.

the global average, thus presenting greater opportunities for women in the sector.17  In the year 
2023, a total of 1622 commercial pilot licenses were issued, of which 18 per cent were issued to 
women. Ministry of Civil Aviation and its associated organisations have taken steps to increase 
the number of pilots in the country. The Airports Authority of India issued award letters for 
nine new Flying Training Organisations (FTO) at five airports, namely Belagavi, Jalgaon, 
Kalaburagi, Khajuraho and Lilabari, in the first phase and six more FTOs at five airports, 
namely Bhavnagar, Hubballi, Kadapa, Kishangarh and Salem in the second phase.18 The sector 
holds significant potential, requiring collaborative efforts between the government, industry 
stakeholders, and international partners. Investments in infrastructure, skill development, and 
sustainability initiatives will fuel the future expansion of the aviation sector in India. 
Tourism 
11.35	 The tourism sector in India is rapidly expanding, with India being ranked at the 39th 
position in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024.19 
Showing positive signs of revival post-pandemic, the industry witnessed over 92 lakh foreign 
tourist arrivals20 in 2023, implying a YoY increase of 43.5 per cent. India has significantly earned 
foreign exchange receipts amounting to over ₹2.3 lakh crore through tourism, indicating a 65.7 
per cent YoY increase. India's share of foreign exchange earnings in world tourism receipts 
increased from 1.38 per cent in 2021 to 1.58 per cent in 2022.

infrastructure development, and 12 have been inaugurated. Swadesh Darshan 2.0, focusing 
on integrated tourism destination development, targets 55 destinations across 32 states and 
Union Territories. India chaired the first Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Tourism 
Expert Working Group, deliberating on collaborative strategies among SCO member nations. 
The Ministry organised the 11th International Tourism Mart and Bharat Parv 2023 to promote 
tourism and cultural exchange. Alongside these efforts, the Government has implemented 
various measures to support the tourism industry, including policy reforms and infrastructure 
development.

11.38	 The tourism sector has embraced the digital revolution. One such initiative is 
E-Marketplace, designed to facilitate interactions between tourists and certified tourist 
facilitators and guides through web and mobile applications. The Union Government, in 
collaboration with State Governments and Union Territory administrations, is actively 
working on registering accommodation units nationwide in the National Integrated Database 
of Hospitality Industry (NIDHI) portal. This database will aid in formulating effective policies 
and strategies for promoting tourism. Another noteworthy initiative is SAATHI (System for 
Assessment, Awareness and Training for Hospitality Industry), which aims to prevent further 
transmission of viruses by educating the hospitality industry on government COVID regulations.

Note: T&T – Travel and Tourism
11.39	 India's travel and tourism (T&T) sector has been influenced by global inflationary 
pressures and delays in the recovery of T&T capacity, similar to other economies. However, 
the decline in price competitiveness since 2021 has been minimal compared to its peers, 
with only a 0.7 per cent drop. India's decline is particularly slight at just 0.1 per cent from 
2021 levels, which reflects the Government’s consistent efforts to maintain stability despite 
the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. WEF's TTDI 2024 report emphasizes the 
need for improvements in tourist services and infrastructure, and the development of a skilled 
workforce. In a challenging environment for employment generation in services due to the rise 
of AI and manufacturing due to rising protectionism, transportation costs and supply concerns, 
the tourism sector represents a relatively low-hanging fruit for job creation. India has to seize 
the opportunity. To formalise employment within this sector, the Ministry of Tourism has 
initiated the Incredible India Tourism Facilitator Certificate Programme27. This program aims 
to create a skilled cadre of tourist facilitators nationwide through a digital platform that offers 
online learning opportunities and certification courses.28

Real Estate
11.40	 Real estate and ownership of dwellings have accounted for over seven per cent of the 
overall GVA in the past decade, highlighting their integral role in the economy. Following two 
challenging years of pandemic-induced lockdowns and economic instability, the real estate 
sector has experienced a robust recovery. The pandemic has shifted homebuyers' preferences 
toward larger, sustainable spaces with additional amenities, driven by remote and hybrid 
working trends. This shift has also spurred interest in peripheral areas close to city centres. 
Factors contributing to the sector's growth include rapid urbanisation, rising income levels, the 
emergence of nuclear families, new entrants in the market, and improved financial options for 
developers and homebuyers. The strong desire for home-ownership was reinforced during the 
pandemic, acting as a catalyst. 
11.41	 In 2023, residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing 
a 33 per cent YoY growth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. The new supply 
witnessed an all-time high, with 5.2 lakh units launched in 2023, as against 4.3 lakh units in 
2022. The momentum continued in Q1 of 2024, witnessing record-breaking sales of 1.2 lakh units, 
clocking a robust 41 per cent YoY growth. New supply has consistently exceeded one lakh units 
since Q2 of 2022, underscoring persistent demand-supply dynamics in the housing market.29
11.42	 Further, the rising demand for housing loans reflects the underlying demand for real 
estate. Housing loans as a percentage of GDP increased from FY12 to FY24 (Chart XI.18). 
Traditionally, banks have been the most significant players in the housing finance sector. 
However, Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) have significantly contributed to this landscape 
over the years. They played a complementary role with banks in providing housing credit to the 
bottom of the pyramid. The share of outstanding housing loans as a percentage of total loans of 
HFCs stood at 70.8 per cent as of 31 March 2024.

11.43	 The housing sector’s growth has been due to several key factors. The Pradhan Mantri 
Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, has sanctioned over 1.2 crore houses for 
urban beneficiaries, ensuring durable housing. Policy reforms like the Goods and Services Tax, 
Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code have 
boosted transparency and investor confidence in real estate. Initiatives like the Affordable 
Housing Fund and Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) 
Investment Fund have supported affordable housing projects. PMAY(U)-Credit Linked Subsidy 
Scheme interest subvention has been a primary demand-side driver, with the National Housing 
Bank (NHB) releasing ₹49,460.1 crore in subsidies benefiting over 21.1 lakh households by 
March 2024. The co-lending model, combining bank liquidity with HFCs', aims to extend 
housing credit to a broader segment, including low-income groups. The Urban Infrastructure 
Development Fund, managed by NHB with an initial corpus of ₹10,000 crore, is expected to 
improve urban infrastructure, attracting real estate investment.
Box XI.2: Building Trust: How RERA is Reshaping Real Estate
The Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), was enacted to bring 
about much-needed reform in India's real estate sector. The main objective of RERA is to 
encourage greater transparency, citizen-centricity, accountability, and financial discipline, 
thus empowering home buyers and boosting the economy. All States/ Union Territories (UTs) 
have notified rules under RERA except Nagaland, which is in the process of notifying the rules.
Key measures and outcomes from RERA's implementation
	
Developer Accountability: Developers frequently failed to deliver promised project 
features, layouts, and amenities, thereby misleading homebuyers. RERA now mandates 
an 'Agreement to Sale' at the time of registration and requires two-thirds consent 
from allottees/homebuyers for any layout changes. RERA also specifies provisions for 
refund, compensation, and penalties applicable to all stakeholders in cases of obligation 
contraventions.
	
Fair Transactions: Before RERA was enacted, there were many cases of builders 
not delivering flats or homes despite full payments from homebuyers.  To address this, 
under RERA, it is mandated that 70 per cent of funds collected from homebuyers for a 
project must be maintained in a separate bank account dedicated to project construction 
and land costs.
	
Disclosures and Mandatory Registration: RERA has also made it mandatory 
for developers and project promoters to make all necessary disclosures about projects, 
including permissions secured from authorities, date of launch, promised date of delivery, 
project specifications, and amenities.30 Further, homebuyers’ interests are protected as 
only the projects (above 500 square metres and above eight apartments) registered with 
RERA can be launched, thereby obviating the possibility of any misrepresentation or 
false promises by the developers.31 As of 01 July 2024, over 1,30,186 real estate projects 
and 88,461 real estate agents have been registered under RERA.

	
Dispute Resolution: RERA provides for the establishment of a fast-track dispute 
resolution mechanism for the settlement of disputes. As of 01 July 2024, 32 States and 
UTs have set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, and 1,24,947 complaints have 
already been disposed of.
After the enactment of RERA, India is ranked 36th in the Global Real Estate Transparency 
Index in 2022.
11.44	 The outlook for the real estate sector is encouraging. With increasing urbanisation, the 
housing industry is poised for a significant transformation. As per the United Nations, by 2050, 
half of India's population is projected to dwell in urban regions, compared to 31 per cent in 
2011.32 This underscores the need to adapt strategies and policies to meet the rising demand for 
housing and offer viable, cost-effective, sustainable solutions.
11.45	 Digitisation of land records is poised to improve transparency in land transactions, 
diminish property ownership conflicts, and enhance the efficiency of land management. 
Implementing a single-window clearance system for construction approvals will also accelerate 
construction processes, minimising delays and uncertainties. The streamlining of approvals is 
set to consolidate and systematise India's residential real estate sector further.
11.46	 The legacy stalled real estate projects is a challenge. Approximately 4.1 lakh stressed 
dwelling units, involving ₹4.1 lakh crore, are affected, as estimated by the Indian Banks' 
Association (IBA). The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) established a 
committee to recommend solutions for completing stalled projects to address this issue.33 
The committee identified the primary cause of stress as lack of financial viability, resulting in 
cost overruns and delays. Its recommendations include mandatory project registrations with 
RERA, execution of registration and sub-lease deeds for occupied units, ensuring possession 
of substantially completed projects, proposing state government rehabilitation packages for 
promoter-led resolutions, establishing frameworks for RERA and administrator-led project 
revivals, financing stalled projects, and utilising IBC as a last resort for resolving projects. 
11.47	 According to a report by Crisil, the housing loan market in India grew at a CAGR of 
approximately 13 per cent from FY18 to FY23. It is expected to continue growing at a CAGR 
of 13 to 15 per cent reaching ₹42 lakh crore to ₹44 lakh crore by FY26. NHB has introduced 
a Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) platform to address funding options 
limitations. This platform aims to attract long-term resources from diverse investor groups, 
including Pension Funds and Insurance Funds, to support the expansion of housing finance 
and deepen the debt market for primary mortgages. The RMBS platform will help reduce asset-
liability mismatches for lending institutions, ensuring adequate liquidity in the housing finance 
sector.

11.48	 Going forward, the demand for housing is expected to be driven by affordability and 
increased access to credit. As of March 2024, the shares of Southern, Western and Northern 
states in the individual housing loans outstanding are 35.4 per cent, 31.2 per cent and 26.2 per 
cent, respectively. The Eastern States at 6.9 per cent and the eight North-eastern and Hilly 
states combining to 0.95 per cent share present an opportunity for undertaking initiatives for 
improving penetration.  
11.49	 Sustainability and technology have emerged as significant disrupters for the real estate 
sector. Sustainability will influence green construction practices and energy-efficient designs, 
while technology will revolutionise smart homes and data-driven insights. With more significant 
environmental concerns, the focus will be on energy-efficient systems, rainwater harvesting 
and smart building technologies.
Information Technology Services, Tech start-ups and Global Capability 
centres
Information Technology (IT) services
11.50	 Over the past decade, information and computer-related services have become 
increasingly significant, with their share of total GVA rising from 3.2 per cent in FY13 to 5.9 
per cent in FY23. Despite the pandemic-induced economic downturn, this sector achieved a 
real growth rate of 10.4 per cent in FY21. The COVID-19 pandemic expedited the advancement 
and uptake of technology-driven solutions, fuelling the growth of this sector. The IT and IT-
enabled services have been instrumental in maintaining the country's external balance through 
export earnings, which are set to increase further. The flourishing growth of IT services has also 
supported the expansion of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and the tech start-up ecosystem 
in India. 
Global Capability Centres 
11.51	 Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in India have grown significantly, from over 1,000 
centres in FY15 to more than 1,580 centres, with over 2,740 units by FY23. These centres 
contribute to economic growth by providing high-quality employment. In FY23, the total 
talent employed in Indian GCCs exceeded 16.6 lakh. Of this workforce, over 42 per cent are 
engaged in engineering, research, and development (ER&D), 34.5 per cent in business process 
management (BPM), and 23.4 per cent in IT services. The software, internet and banking, 
financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sectors collectively account for about 58 per cent of 
India's IT GCC talent. Revenue from India's GCCs has increased from USD 19.4 billion in FY15 
to USD 46 billion in FY23, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 per cent.

11.52	 As per National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), the key 
drivers for the growth of ER&D in India include strategic long-term partnerships, extensive 
digitalisation, and the adoption of cloud technologies. The IT services segment has expanded due 
to increased demand for application modernisation, cloud migration, platform development, and 
enhanced cybersecurity measures. The BPM sector in Indian GCCs has grown by transitioning 
from traditional services to more intelligent operations and data-driven solutions.
11.53	  The technology sectors are dynamic and continually evolving, making them lucrative 
for employees and businesses. IT positions remain among the most in-demand roles in the 
global job market. Despite the high demand, these sectors are experiencing a talent gap, with 
a shortage of IT, data science, and cybersecurity workers. As per a survey34, for Q3 2024, 76 
per cent of IT employers reported difficulty in finding the skilled talent required globally. To 
incentivise GCCs in India, promoting specialisations in higher education is essential. Focus 
areas should include Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Internet 
of Things, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, Augmented Reality, Virtual 
Reality, 3D Printing, and Web and Mobile Development.
11.54	  Several initiatives are in place to bridge the talent gap. Conceived as a first-of-its-
kind initiative, ‘Future Skills PRIME’, which is a joint initiative by Ministry of Electronics & 
Information Technology (MeitY) and NASSCOM, aims to create an up-skilling and re-skilling 
ecosystem in focus areas to facilitate the continuous enhancement of skills of IT professionals in 
line with their aspirations and aptitude.35 The Government initiated a Digital Skilling program in 
emerging and future technologies, aiming to skill, reskill, and upskill one crore students through 
internships, apprenticeships, and employment opportunities.36 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas

Technology start-ups in India 
11.55	 The COVID-19 pandemic fuelled consumer and enterprise demand for technology-
backed solutions. The number of technology start-ups in India rose remarkably from around 
2,000 in 2014 to approximately 31,000 in 2023. As per NASSCOM, the sector witnessed the 
inception of roughly 1000 new tech start-ups in 2023.
11.56	 The top sectors for start-ups in 2023 were EdTech (16 per cent), EnterpriseTech (12 
per cent), BFSI (10 per cent), Advertising and Marketing (7 per cent), RetailTech (6 per cent), 
Media and Entertainment (5 per cent), ConsumerTech (5 per cent), Professional services (4 per 
cent) and Gaming (4 per cent).
11.57	 Several factors have contributed to the rise of start-ups in various sectors. Changes in 
consumption patterns and increased internet penetration paved the way for retail tech start-
ups. The BFSI sector saw a surge in start-ups starting in 2016, driven by significant events 
such as the introduction of UPI. The demand for scalable and efficient cloud solutions led to 
the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) start-ups, resulting in 21 unicorns since 2014. The 
COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth in sectors like HealthTech and EdTech, spurred by the 
increased need for tele-consulting and remote learning solutions.
11.58	 As per NASSCOM, India’s tech start-up ecosystem ranks third globally and has 
performed considerably better than the USA and the UK.39 The strength of the Indian tech 
start-up ecosystem lies in its large pool of start-ups, unicorns, and ability to scale. With 16 
per cent of the world's AI talent, India positions itself as an innovation hub, showcasing rapid 
adoption of AI skills.
11.59	 The Start-up India Initiative and Start-up hubs across ministries and departments 
of the Government of India have aided the growth of tech start-ups. Some other significant 
initiatives are the National Deep Tech Start-up Policy, the Drone Shakti Program and custom 
duty exemptions for EV-related capital goods and machinery. Targeted efforts undertaken to 
tap this start-up potential further are elaborated below.
	
Accelerating and strengthening the deep-tech ecosystem: As of 31 March 2024, 
there are more than 1.25 lakh DPIIT-recognized start-ups spanning across all sectors 
of the economy, out of which there are over 13,000 start-ups that cover sectors like AI, 
Internet of Things, Robotics, and Nanotechnology. The draft National Deep Tech Start-up 
Policy (NDTSP)40 is a comprehensive framework to tackle deep tech start-ups' challenges.

The policy addresses vital barriers such as limited funding, resource and infrastructure 
constraints, and understanding the risks associated with cutting-edge technologies. It 
intervenes by designing funding mechanisms that embrace the concept of ‘failing by design’, 
conducting funding awareness programs for start-up founders to diversify their funding 
sources, establishing a centralised core mission office to streamline approval processes and 
facilitate intellectual property protection, fostering awareness in Tier 2 and 3 cities, and 
designing a monitoring mechanism based on mapping key performance indicators.

	
Strengthening domestic capital flow: The Government has established a Fund of 
Funds for Start-ups with a corpus of ₹10,000 crores to meet the funding needs of start-
ups. It has not only made capital available for start-ups at an early stage, seed stage and 
growth stage but also played a catalytic role in facilitating the raising of domestic capital, 
reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging homegrown and new venture 
capital funds. Recognising the importance of early-stage support for enterprise growth, the 
Start-up India Seed Fund Scheme, launched in 2021, aims to provide financial assistance 
to start-ups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market-entry, and 
commercialisation.41
	
Leveraging initiatives such as Start-Up India: The Start-up India initiative helps 
connect the Indian start-up ecosystem to global start-up ecosystems. Start-up India has 
engaged in several bilateral and multilateral forums to build cross-border knowledge 
exchange systems and facilitate cross-border incubation and acceleration programs.42

Telecommunications
11.60	 Telecommunication is the gateway to the fast-paced growth of digital services in 
India. The overall teledensity (number of telephones per 100 population) in India increased 
from 75.2 per cent in March 2014 to 85.7 per cent in March 2024.43  The number of wireless 
telephone connections stood at 116.5 crore at the end of March 2024. The Government has 
placed considerable emphasis on the growth of internet and broadband as part of the Digital 
India campaign. As a result, internet subscribers jumped from 25.1 crore in March 2014 to 95.4 
crore in March 2024, of whom 91.4 crore are accessing the internet via wireless phones. The 
internet density also increased to 68.2 per cent in March 2024. The cost of data has declined 
substantially, vastly improving the average wireless data usage per subscriber.
11.61	 5G services were first launched in India in October 2022. Currently, India is amongst the 
fastest-growing 5G networks in the world. After the launch of 5G services, India's international 
rank in mobile broadband speed has improved from 118 to 15 (March 2024). The ‘5G Test Bed’, 
dedicated to the nation in 2022, provides an end-to-end testing facility, enabling R&D teams 
in Indian academia and industry to validate their products, prototypes, and algorithms and 
demonstrate various services. The Bharat 5G Portal propels India's 5G capabilities and fosters 
innovation, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing within the telecom sector.
11.62	 Based on the recommendations of the Technology Innovation Group on 6G, the 
Bharat 6G Vision document was launched in March 2023 to develop and deploy 6G network 
technologies in India. It also led to the constitution of Bharat 6G Mission and an Apex Council 
to lay down the Phase-wise objectives of the 6G Mission. The Bharat 6G Alliance was also 
launched in July 2023 as a collaborative platform of public and private companies, academia, 
research institutions and standards development organisations to enable India to become a 
leading global supplier of IP, products and solutions of affordable 5G, 6G and other future 
telecom solutions. 
11.63	 The Amended BharatNet Program is now being rolled out to provide broadband 
connectivity to all Gram Panchayats in the country. As of 31 March, 2024, 6,83,175 kilometers 
of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, connecting a total of 2,06,709 Gram Panchayats 
(GPs) by OFC in the BharatNet phase I & II.
11.64	 The Government has also implemented multiple structural and procedural reforms 
to promote healthy competition, reduce the regulatory burden on telecom service providers, 
and protect consumers' interests. These include rationalising the definition of adjusted 
gross revenue, spectrum-related reforms like allowing sharing and trading of spectrum and 
rationalising spectrum usage charges, permission for 100 per cent foreign direct investment in 
the telecom sector under automatic route subject to safeguards, etc. The Telecommunications 
Act 2023 amends and consolidates the laws relating to telecommunication services and 
telecommunication networks, assignment of spectrum, etc. 
11.65	 Telecommunication technology development requires significantly large and patient 
capital for R&D and commercialisation. To address this, the Government has decided that

an allocation of 5 per cent of annual collections from the Universal Services Obligation 
Fund44 (USOF) would be made available for funding R&D in the telecom sector. The Telecom 
Technology Development Fund formulated in 2022 has seen significant participation from 
start-ups, MSMEs, academia and industry. 
11.66	 New courses have been suggested to align engineering programs in electronics and 
communications with evolving needs in the industry. Skill courses related to 5G and 5G-enabled 
technology have been approved by the National Council for Vocational Education and Training 
(NCVET). All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has also included 5G as a thrust 
area in the AICTE Training and Learning Academy scheme for the faculty development program.
11.67	 Sanchar Saathi portal45, launched in May 2023, is a citizen-centric initiative to empower 
mobile subscribers, strengthen their security and increase awareness. Sanchar Saathi portal has 
several components, including the Chakshu facility, launched in March 2024, to report suspected 
fraud communications. Based on complaints received, appropriate actions are being taken. 
E-Commerce
11.68	 The Indian e-commerce industry is expected to cross USD 350 billion by 2030. The 
Indian retail market is largely unorganised. However, over the next 3 to 5 years, the share of 
modern retail (including e-commerce) will increase to 30-35 per cent of the total retail.46
11.69	 India’s e-commerce market has gained significant momentum during the past few 
years owing to technological advancements, evolving new-age business models coupled with 
government initiatives like the Digital India program, UPI, One District - One Product (ODOP) 
initiative, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), new foreign trade policy, relaxation in 
FDI limits and Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) (Amendment) Rules 2021. At the heart of 
the rapid expansion of e-commerce is the diversity of benefits the e-marketplace offers sellers 
and consumers compared to traditional brick-and-mortar markets. 
11.70	 The rise of e-commerce is constrained by inadequate skills required for online selling, 
such as cataloguing. Data privacy issues and increasing online fraud have turned out to be the 
most significant hurdle in the growth of e-commerce in India. It becomes imperative to educate 
users on the safe use of e-commerce platforms. For starters, the Government has implemented 
several initiatives to ensure the safe use of e-commerce platforms. Key regulations include the 
Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, to safeguard consumers from unfair trade 
practices in e-commerce and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital 
Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, ensuring digital platform accountability. The Digital Personal 
Data Protection Act, 2023 provides a comprehensive data protection framework, further 
safeguarding consumer information.
44  The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) aims to provide quality and affordable mobile and digital services 
across the rural and remote areas of the country, allowing non-discriminatory access to mobile and network 
services along with equitable access to knowledge and information dissemination, leading to rapid socio-
economic development with improved standard of living.

11.71	 To raise awareness, the Government runs the Jago Grahak Jago campaign, providing 
consumers with information on their rights and safe e-commerce practices. The National 
Consumer Helpline (NCH) offers guidance and resolves consumer grievances.47 Various 
consumer awareness programs, including digital literacy workshops and cyber safety sessions, 
are organised in collaboration with NGOs and educational institutions. Additionally, interactive 
sessions and webinars with experts and officials keep consumers informed about the latest 
trends and safety measures in the e-commerce sector.
11.72	 The buyer ecosystem in India is evolving at a very sharp rate, and business models will 
need to innovate to serve the needs of a diverse shopper base regarding service expectations, 
price sensitivity and language requirements. Local language platforms are needed as the 
shopper base expands to tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Growing start-ups and innovative social media 
platforms provide an opportunity to test unique business models that might be targeted to 
specific demographic cohorts.48 E-commerce’s future is built on the enhanced user experience 
through AI, seamless digital payment methods, innovations like UPI, and business engineering 
data analytics for business operations and enhancements. Further, platforms such as ONDC 
and Government e-Marketplace (GeM) increase the outreach of e-commerce capabilities. 
Box XI.3: ONDC- Democratising Digital Commerce
Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a pioneering initiative of the Department 
for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, aimed to democratise digital commerce and 
enable small businesses to capitalise on the benefits of digital commerce by creating a level 
playing field. The ONDC network is premised on the fundamentals of unbundling and making 
various components of digital commerce interoperable. ONDC started in January 2022 and 
rapidly expanded its twin domains of mobility and food and beverage to various domains 
like grocery, fashion, beauty and personal care, home and kitchen, on-network logistics, 
agriculture, gift cards, Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs) and artisanal works.

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
11.73	 This section summarises the challenges and growth opportunities that cut across 
different segments of services, presented in different sections above. 
	
The rapid digitisation in the services sector necessitates a skilled workforce to keep pace 
with technological advancements. However, there is a gap in the availability of workers with 
relevant digital and high-tech skills. The Government has been focusing on skill development 
initiatives through programs like Skill India and the National Education Policy to equip the 
workforce with the necessary skills. Upskilling in the technology sector via an ecosystem 
fostered by government initiatives in collaboration with industry can help India emerge as 
a high-value partner specialising in areas such as cybersecurity, enterprise management, 
financial risk management and insurance.
	
In recognition of the importance of logistics and transport services for economic activity, 
several initiatives have been undertaken to ease infrastructure bottlenecks, logistics costs, 
and regulatory compliances. Additionally, leveraging India's extensive coastline and river 
network for enhanced services such as port operations and inland waterways promises 
significant potential to streamline transportation routes, reduce costs, and improve 
efficiency. The Netherlands boasts Europe's densest network of inland waterways, covering 
approximately 6,000 kilometres of rivers and canals. These waterways serve various 
purposes, including drainage and navigation. Key commercial routes (Class IV and higher), 
totalling 2,200 kilometres, handle about 40 per cent of international freight movements 
and 20 per cent of domestic freight within the country.49 Kerala's use of its backwaters 
for tourism, commerce, and transportation, particularly the Kochi Water Metro, which 
is expected to benefit 33,000 islanders, highlights the potential of inland waterways.50 
Adopting similar strategies nationwide can enhance India's inland water transport system, 
support sustainable growth, and ease congestion.
	
Accessing finance can pose difficulties, particularly for small and medium enterprises 
operating in the services sector.51 Several initiatives, such as Mudra Yojana, Start-up India 
and Stand-up India, have been implemented to ease credit accessibility. Building on these 
efforts, focusing on streamlining loan processes, expanding the outreach of credit guarantee 
schemes, adopting alternative credit appraisal methods, and innovating supply chain 
financing can further augment credit flow to the sector. Governments at appropriate levels 
may also set up agencies to assist in project documentation and to improve the bankability 
of projects.
	
The regulatory landscape in the services sector, which used to be complex, is undergoing 
positive transformations. Initiatives like GST simplification, Start-up India, and sector-
specific policies such as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act are fostering a 
more conducive business environment.  Further enhancing the simplification of procedures

through single-window systems, streamlining legal provisions, and digitising government 
processes at all administrative levels can significantly boost economic efficiency.
	
Data privacy and cybersecurity have become critical concerns with the increasing 
digitisation of services. Given this, the Government is spearheading data protection laws and 
cybersecurity policies to safeguard consumer data and strengthen cybersecurity measures in 
the services sector. To further embrace technology with confidence, ensuring the adoption 
of strong security measures, compliance with privacy regulations, and fostering innovation 
in security technologies are essential.
CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD 
11.74	 Historically, India's services sector has thrived on low-cost offerings. The digitisation of 
services, coupled with appropriate policy nudges, kept progressively transforming the nature of 
service delivery almost irreversibly during the early part of the last decade. This trend accelerated 
post the pandemic. Another distinct pattern that emerged during the last three years is that the 
contact-intensive business and personal services—prominently trade, transport, real estate and 
their ancillary services — that underwent a steep decline during the pandemic are recovering, 
embedding greater technology and digital content in them. At the same time, India’s services 
exports are diversifying beyond software to include Human Resources (HR), legal, and design 
services in line with emerging global demands. Thus, two significant transformations are 
reshaping India's services landscape: the rapid technology-driven transformation of domestic 
service delivery and the diversification of India's services exports. 
11.75	 The country is emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres. Domestically, start-ups 
drive innovation, improving access to credit, raw materials, and markets. Aided by the deep 
technology ecosystem and the consistent policy push, many technology start-ups are digitising 
manufacturing and other services. The embedded service content of the non-service economic 
activities has increased significantly, as evidenced by the National Accounts Statistics. The 
post-production value addition in activities is also increasingly dependent on services like 
e-commerce, innovative packaging and advertisement and modern logistics services.  
11.76	 As India looks forward to creating millions of jobs by 2030, dovetailing this transformation 
in the demand-supply dynamics of services is pivotal to meeting the hiring requirements in 
the medium term. The emerging job demands in the services sector entail greater and more 
focussed skills. The World Economic Forum's report52 highlights an increasing focus on 
cognitive abilities (like complex problem-solving and creative thinking), digital literacy, and 
proficiency in AI and big data. This shift underscores the strategic imperative for businesses 
and the workforce to adapt to technological advancements and meet global market demands. 
Focus areas should include blockchain, AI, machine learning, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, 
cloud computing, big data analytics, augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D printing, and web 
and mobile development. Thus, the immediate task of the skilling programme in India is to

plan and equip itself to meet these requirements adequately. A report by Capital Economics 
argues that AI could lead to a slowing down of India’s services export growth, cutting it by 0.3-
0.4 percentage points a year over the next decade.53 This only underscores the importance of 
the relatively less skill-dependent tourism sector for employment generation. Therefore, public 
policy should pay particular attention to boosting the tourism sector. Governments at all levels 
and the private sector must work together to realise the sector’s potential.54
11.77	 In the short run, tentative global economic outlook and commodity price uncertainties 
present a serious challenge to input costs and demand for services55. Thus, sustaining positive 
demand trends and effectively managing rising costs and competitive pressures will be critical 
for the services sector's continued growth and resilience in the upcoming year. The post-
pandemic dynamism shown by the economy and the services sector, in particular, should help 
transcend these uncertainties and challenges.

55  As per the latest Supply and Use Tables for 2019-20 published by the Central Statistics Office, bulk of the inputs 
used in the production of services in India originate from commodity-producing (agricultural and industrial) 
sectors. So, pressure on commodity prices can significantly affect the input cost of services and, hence, their 
demand.

CHAPTER

INFRASTRUCTURE: LIFTING 
POTENTIAL GROWTH
The foremost among the responses initiated by the Union Government to overcome 
the pandemic-driven slowdown in the economy was increase in capital expenditure, 
aimed particularly at the creation of high quality physical and social infrastructure 
facilities. Keeping the momentum going over the last five years, capital expenditure 
of the Government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24, relative to FY20 
levels. The major beneficiaries of this step-up are key foundational assets like roads and 
railways. 
The burgeoning public investment has been complemented by a host of institutional and 
procedural reforms that facilitated project execution and timely issue resolutions. These 
include initiatives to enhance private sector participation through PPPs, facilitative 
measures like National Infrastructure Pipeline and Project Monitoring Group, de-
bottlenecking procedures PM-GatiShakti, and novel instruments such as REITS and 
InvITs to ease the constraints on long-term finances required for infrastructure 
investments. 
The Chapter shows that, with increased public investment over the last five years, 
India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and 
social infrastructure including sanitation and water supply helping to improve quality 
of life of the people. At the same time, given the fiscal compulsions and consolidation 
plans of the Union and the State Governments, it is important that viable projects on 
the public-private participation mode emerge and get executed. Regular collection 
of sector-wise, source-wise information on infrastructure investment, bottom-up 
studies and aggregation of requirements of infrastructure and periodic assessment of 
utilisation of assets created will help making mid-course corrections on the country’s  
developmental path.
INTRODUCTION
12.1.	 Creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure—physical, social, financial and digital—is 
a key plank of India’s policy strategy to become ViksitBharat @ 2047. However, recent studies 
by the Asian Development Bank1 and the World Bank2 and recent estimates made by agencies 
like CRISIL3 have identified gaps in infrastructure investment in different sectors. Against this 
background, this chapter examines the recent developments in India’s infrastructure space 
with a special focus on the progress achieved in FY24.

12.2.	The Chapter is divided into six sections. Section II investigates the question of  
infrastructure financing within the limitations of data and stresses the need for greater balance 
between private capital and public investment, which will be constrained by the requirements of 
fiscal consolidation by the Government. Section III discusses sectoral developments, challenges 
and outlook. Discussion on financial infrastructure and on social infrastructures like health 
and education is not covered in this chapter as these subjects are discussed in chapters 2, 7 and 
8 respectively. The fourth section shows the glimpse of the challenges and the opportunities 
across the infrastructure sector. Section V examines the efforts by the Government to reduce 
the bottlenecks in India’s infrastructure sector. Section VI summarises the discussions and 
presents some important aspects of the way forward. 
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING: THE PUBLIC 
EXPENDITURE PUSH
12.3.	This section brings out two important facts about infrastructure financing in India. 
Firstly, despite many financial innovations in infrastructure financing in the recent years, 
capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments still have the central role in funding 
of large-scale infrastructure projects. Secondly, with the emergence of a number of new funding 
instruments and strategies, the infrastructure financing space has become complex, and, given 
the differential definitions and patterns followed in maintenance of statistics by different 
agencies, it is difficult to aggregate the total flow of funds for the creation of infrastructure in 
any given year. 
12.4.	Even though budgetary capital expenditure cannot be equated to infrastructure spending4, 
the infrastructure thrust of the Government has led to an unprecedented increase in capital 
expenditure. Chart XII.1 shows that the capital expenditure of the Union Government increased 
by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24 (PA) while that of the State governments increased by 2.1 times 
during the same period.
12.5.	 The capital expenditure of the Union Government broadly includes two components—
the spending by its line departments and the gross budgetary support (GBS) given to the 
Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The share of gross budgetary support to two key 
connectivity segments, i.e., Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total 
capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4 per cent in FY21 to 42.9 per 
cent in FY24 (RE). These two components of capital expenditure increased by 2.6 times from 
FY21 to FY24 (RE) in their absolute values.
12.6.	The aggregate investible resources of the CPSEs consists of the GBS and the resources 
raised by CPSEs themselves. In order to optimise the combined borrowing cost of the Union 
Government and the CPSEs, the higher-cost borrowings of the two major infra-CPSEs—NHAI 
and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) - were progressively reduced from FY21 to 
FY24. This is, to a large extent, reflected in the reduction in the own resources of the CPSEs in 
4  Capital expenditure of the Government includes its spending to create any capital asset, which may not be created 
under a sector classified as infrastructure under the harmonious definition of infrastructure.

         (iii) Data for resources of public enterprises for FY24 is a revised estimate
12.7.	 The support of the Union Government for capital expenditure of the State Governments 
and instititions increased by 31.6 per cent during FY21 and FY24. Further analysis of the 
capital expenditure of the State Governments is not possible as the data on the GBS by the 
State Government to the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and the resources mobilised 
by SPSEs themselves are not available in a consolidated form. 
12.8.	Charts XII.3 through XII.9 on important non-government sources of funding reiterates the 
fact that the recent infrastructure thrust in India, especially the surge in connectivity projects, 
has banked predominantly on public expenditure. The net flow of funds to infrastructure 
sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was only around ₹79,000 
crore, much less than the GBS by the Union Government for either railways or roads. Charts 
XII.3 to XII.5 also show that the net flow of bank credit between March 2020 and March 2024 
was concentrated in only a few sectors roads, airports and power. However, the credit growth 
to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5 per cent, as against the growth of 2.3 per cent, 
in FY23. 
12.9.	The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors also picked 
up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24, as against an average of USD 5.91 billion during FY20 to FY23.

National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)
12.10.	 NMP was announced in August 2021 on the principle of ‘asset creation through 
monetisation’ i.e., tapping private sector investment for new infrastructure creation. The 
aggregate monetisation potential under NMP was estimated at ₹6.0 lakh crore through core 
assets of the Government, over four-years from FY22 to FY256. The pipeline contained more 
than 20 asset classes across 12 Ministries.
12.11.	Ministries are proactively working on developing a pipeline and transactions have been 
undertaken in line with their strategic initiatives. During the first two years, i.e., 2021-22 and 
2022-23, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments 
were completed under the core asset monetisation programme. Further, in 2023-24, 
transactions aggregating to ₹1.51 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed, 
1.55 times those achieved in 2021-22.
DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS
12.12.	 This section discusses the progress in key infrastructure sectors along with outlook and 
challenges, including covering physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban

development, strategic and digital infrastructure. An attempt has been made to present only 
the details relating to infrastructure development in this chapter, leaving the discussion on 
infrastructure-related services to chapter on services. 
Physical Connectivity Infrastructure 
Road Transport 
12.13.	 Strategic planning and step-up in public investment have resulted in the upgradation of 
the road network system into a resilient and efficient infrastructure. The capital investment by 
the Government and private sector rose from 0.4 per cent in FY15 to about 1.0 per cent of GDP 
(around ₹3.01 lakh crore) in FY24. The sector has attracted its highest-ever private investment 
in FY24 as the private sector capitalises on a conducive policy environment. Further, tapping 
on the private investment, funds garnered through asset monetisation in the roads sector have 
exceeded ₹1 lakh crore since FY19. Notably, the Government achieved its highest-ever asset 
monetisation revenues of ₹40,314 crore in FY24.
12.14.	 Over the last ten years, there has been significant progress in the development of national 
highways, increasing by 1.6 times from 2014 to 2024. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly 
expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 
times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024. Further, the efficiency of highway 
construction has improved due to the systematic push through the corridor-based National 
Highway development approach. The average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times 
from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The remarkable improvement of 
the NH network has brought about substantial advancements in logistics efficiency. This is 
evidenced by the consistently rising India’s ranking in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance 
Index, from 54 in 2014 and 44 in 2018, to 38 in 2023.

12.15.	 To further enhance logistic efficiency, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways 
(MoRT&H) has dedicated Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP). A total of six multimodal 
logistics parks (MMLPs) have been awarded until FY24, and ₹2,505 crore have been awarded 
for dedicated multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) in FY24. Further, seven MMLPs are planned 
to be awarded in FY25. 
Box XII.2: Key Initiatives Enhancing Road Connectivity
●	
Toll digitisation has reduced waiting time at toll plazas by nearly 16 times from 734 
seconds to 47 seconds during 2014-247. Free flow tolling through Automatic Number 
Plate Recognition/Global Navigation Satellite System has also been initiated.
●	
About 900 wayside amenities (WSAs) are planned to be established to provide world-
class facilities and amenities. 322 WSAs have already been awarded out of which 50 are 
operational. In FY24 alone, 162 WSAs have been awarded.
●	
A proactive policy for NH maintenance has been adopted by engaging a contractual 
maintenance agency for each km of the entire NH network. Contractual maintenance 
is done either through performance-based maintenance contracts or short-term 
maintenance contracts. About 37,500 km of NH network has been taken up under 
these two maintenance contracts. Long-term maintenance contracts on developed NH 
stretches of about 20 years have also been undertaken through toll operate transfer and 
infrastructure investment trust mode.
●	
Sustainable raw materials and new-age construction techniques have been incorporated 
into highway development. 13.79 lakh tonnes of inert material from landfill sites have 
been used in urban extension road-II and spur of the Delhi-Mumbai expressway. 
Recycling of bitumen & asphalt is done during the brownfield upgradation of NHs. 
●	
High-tech machinery and cloud-based data-driven construction have resulted in time 
and cost reduction.
●	
Under the “Parvatmala Pariyojana” to boost last-mile religious and tourist connectivity, 
six ropeway projects have been awarded. Bids have been received for another two 
projects. 
12.16.	 Outlook: The development of expressways and corridors, along with the adoption 
of transformative initiatives to promote user convenience and environmental sustainability, 
have been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. However, continuous ribbon 
development along developed NHs is posing a challenge for the construction of a new parallel 
road/bypass. Now, the Government has started focusing on the development of access-
controlled NHs. The Government is also targeting to make all NHs a minimum of two lanes with 
paved shoulders standards. Another challenge is the slow onboarding of digital land records, 
leading to land acquisition delays. This is further impacted by delays in approvals for forest and 
other environmental clearances.

12.21.	 Outlook: The key focus areas for Railways include fast capacity augmentation, 
modernisation of rolling stock and maintenance, improving quality of services and energy 
efficiency. In line with this, investments are prioritised in areas like dedicated freight corridors, 
high-speed rail, modern passenger services like Vande Bharat, Amrit Bharat Express, Aastha 
Special Trains, high-capacity rolling stock and last-mile rail linkages. Projects for three major 
corridors viz. (1) High-traffic density corridors, (2) Energy, Mineral and Cement Corridors and 
(3) Rail Sagar (port connectivity) corridors are also planned to reduce logistics cost and carbon 
footprint. Railways has also planned to reduce its carbon footprint primarily through sourcing 
of its energy requirements through renewable energy sources. The expected requirement of 
installation of renewable capacity by 2029-30 is around 30 Giga Watts. Other strategies include 
shifting from diesel to electric traction, promotion of energy efficiency and afforestation. Carbon 
emission by 2029-30 as per business-as-usual mode is estimated to be 60 million tonnes8. As

of March 2024, ~231 Mega Watt (MW) of solar plants (both on Rooftops and on land) and 
about 103 MW of wind power plants have been commissioned. Further, about 5,750 MW of 
renewable capacity has also been tied up. 
Water Transport
12.22.	 Indian ports are rapidly expanding capacity to meet growing trade. Major port capacity 
has nearly doubled since 2014. Improved connectivity through coordinated planning under the 
PM Gati-Shakti National Master Plan and a focus on public-private partnerships have enhanced 
India’s maritime competitiveness globally. India’s rank in the International Shipments category 
in the World Bank Logistics Performance Index has improved to 22nd in 2023 from 44th in 2014. 
Further, policy reforms and the induction of new technology have enhanced port efficiency and 
productivity. As mentioned in chapter 4 on the External Sector, the container turnaround time 
has dropped by 50 per cent between 2014 and 2023-24. The union capital expenditure towards 
ports, shipping and waterways sector has grown by 27 per cent between FY23 and FY24.

12.33.	 21 Greenfield airports were accorded in-principle approval, out of which 12 airports 
have been operationalised. During FY24, new terminal buildings at 21 airports have been 
operationalised which has led to an overall increase in passenger handling capacity of these 
airports by approximately 62 million passengers per annum. During last seven years, after 
commencement of Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), 
1,390 valid awarded routes have been allotted to various airlines. Out of this, 579 RCS routes 
connecting 85 unserved and underserved airports have been operationalized.
Box XII. 7: New Segments – Drones, Leasing and MRO
●	
Drones offer vast benefits across sectors like agriculture, healthcare, disaster relief, 
surveillance, and defence. The Government introduced liberalized drone rules in 2021. 
Other measures include publishing drone airspace maps, implementing a PLI scheme, 
and introducing a drone certification scheme. Key progress includes the establishment 
of 109 training organisations and the issuance of 10,603 remote pilot certificates, 
22,943 unique identification numbers for registered drones, and 67 DGCA-approved 
Type-Certificate for drone models.
●	
The Government is promoting aircraft leasing through the International Financial 
Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City. More than 28 aircraft lessors have already 
registered, which have together leased more than 20 aircraft and 49 aircraft engines. 
Recently, Air India has commenced leasing of its wide body aircrafts from the IFSC zone 
and other airlines are also in process of establishing leasing company in IFSC.
●	
Realising the potential of the MRO industry in India, the Government has introduced 
several policies and regulations to bring India’s MRO sector at par with global peers. 
MROs in India have enhanced their capacities in traditional segments such as airframes 
and the industry is branching to other MRO segments such as engines in collaboration 
with global OEMs. After the announcement of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP- 
2016), the number of MROs in India has increased to 147, from 114 in 2016. The setting 
up of new MROs has increased employment in the sector. More airports are building 
MRO facilities to add capacity thereby addressing infrastructure constraints.
Outlook: The number of airports in India has more than doubled since 2014. However, there 
is need to augment this capacity by adding more airports as well as expansion/upgradation 
of existing airports in the next five years. In spite of impressive growth in the last decade in 
the Indian aviation market, there is still largely untapped potential. At around 0.13 air trips 
per capita12, the current passenger air traffic is a fraction of India’s potential. MRO and skill 
development will fuel the growth of the sector further. Initiatives such as the International 
Aviation Hub Strategy and engagements with global bodies signal India’s intent to emerge 
as a key player in the global aviation landscape. For India to take a leadership position in 
aviation, focus is required on improving the efficiency and viability of airlines while ensuring 
environmental sustainability. A large proportion of Indian international traffic for the long

Organic waste management
●	
Indore’s 500 tonnes per day (TPD) Bio-methanation Plant Set up in PPP Model: In 
November 2021, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC), established 500 TPD Bio-
methanation plant. The plant operates on DBFOT Model which is Design-Build-Finance-
Operate-Transfer as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The plant generates around 
44,000 - 45,000 m3 of raw biogas daily from which around 17,000 kg of bio-CNG is 
produced every day. The CBG plant has contributed to reducing 1,30,000 CO2 emissions 
annually. 
●	
Black Soldier Flies (BSF) being used in Mangalore for treatment of wet waste: A facility 
has been set up in Mangalore as part of a public-private partnership for treating around 
10,000 tonnes of wet waste annually. Innovative technology in BSFs breeding provides 
an advantage of large-scale deployment at rapid speed to consume all the wet waste 
quantity of a city and thereby solve the problem of wet waste management. It takes 12-14 
days for the wet waste to be converted into compost through BSFs compared to 45-60 
days in the case of aerobic composting. 
●	
Indore Bio CNG: The plant boasts a processing capacity of 400 metric tons per day, 
operating under a Public Private Partnership. The plant processes organic waste, 
yielding 14.8 metric tons of Bio-CNG for use as transportation fuel and 80 metric tons 
of Fermented Organic Manure daily.
Waste to Electricity
●	
Waste to Electricity plant in Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation: The  
biodegradable waste is converted into Compost and sold to nearby farmers. The project 
includes a material recovery facility with a capacity of 1000 TPD, which features 
mechanised windrow composting of 500 TPD. The energy generated from the waste 
to energy plant is captive use for municipal purposes and any other use with the 
corporation’s consent. The project is being operated on a PPP Model on a DBFOT basis 
(Design, Build, Finance, Operate, and Transfer).
12.49.	 Outlook: It is expected that by 2030, more than 40 per cent25 of India’s population will 
live in urban areas, cities need to be transformed into economic centres of growth by building 
future-ready urban infrastructure with combined efforts of central, state, and urban local 
bodies. This can be achieved by efficiently planning urban areas, developing robust project 
frameworks, and strengthening urban local bodies (ULBs). Project-based funding models with 
clearly ring-fenced revenue streams can effectively tap not only viability gap-based funding but 
also market borrowings and credit enhancement structures. ULBs and project-implementing 
agencies need to undertake value-for-money analysis and apply the waterfall mechanism to 
derive the optimum mode for implementing the projects.

The first private launchpad and mission control centre was established by M/s Agnikul 
Cosmos Pvt. Ltd., Chennai in ISRO campus at SDSC, SHAR on 25th November 2022. 
●	
HAL and L&T consortia has been selected as the Indian industry partner for the end-to-
end production of five PSLVs.
●	
The process for transfer of small satellite launch vehicle technology has been initiated. 
12.53.	 Adoption of space-based technology and services are often related to their adequate 
integration into the societal applications, towards meeting the requirements of end users. 
Major technological areas wherein a developmental gap exists include the development of 
indigenous capability for the realisation of carbon fibres, dedicated captive semiconductor 
fab for space applications, availability of major alloying elements, etc. Challenges related 
to the commercialisation of technologies include the presence of a very niche and/or 
competitive marketplace, pricing constraints, typically limited demand that inhibits large-scale 
commercialisation, lack of visibility of long-term demand, etc.
Digital Infrastructure 
12.54.	 The construction sector accounted for around 9 per cent of India’s annual GVA (2023-
24), however, it is amongst the least digitalised sectors. In recent years, various aspects of 
infrastructure development have been integrated with technology to improve the efficiency 
of infrastructure plans, designs, and assets. Some of the most significant uses of technology 
have been through PM GatiShakti, Bhuvan, BharatMaps, Single Window Systems, PARIVESH 
portal, National Data Analytics Platform, Unified Logistics Interface Platform, Pro-Active 
Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI), India Investment Grid (IIG) and many 
similar dashboards and data stacks for almost all ministries. 
Box XII.22: Building Information Modelling (BIM)
●	
According to the OCMS26, about 27% of projects witness cost overruns, whereas 
45% witness time overruns. One of the least digitalised sectors, it is estimated 
that 20% of time is lost in searching relevant information in infrastructure and  
construction sector.
26  Online Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) for Projects and Infrastructure Monitoring – initiative 
of The Project Monitoring Division and Programme Implementation Wing in the Ministry of Statistics and 
Programme Implementation (MOS&PI) that provides management services by providing latest information on 
implementation of projects costing Rs 150 crores and above and performance of infrastructure sectors.

Economic Survey 2023-24
438
●	
It is estimated that for complex infrastructure projects in India, adopting BIM can 
reduce the average project delays of 39 months, reduce infrastructure construction 
costs up to 30 per cent, maintenance costs up to 20 per cent, information and systemic 
inefficiencies up to 20 per cent, construction sector related carbon emission up to 38 
per cent, water consumption up to 10 per cent and improve investments in construction 
R&D by one per cent, and result in over four million skilled professional employment 
and about 2.5 million additional construction sector jobs by reinvesting savings in 
additional infrastructure.
●	
The motto of BIM is to construct digitally before constructing physically. Niti Aayog 
has identified the challenges, solutions and enablers related to BIM implementation. 
Relevant public/ private and academic stakeholders have been identified and are being 
engaged. Based on a roadmap for creating an ecosystem towards faster adoption of 
BIM in India, guidance, and strategies are being provided to infrastructure projects, 
including Central Vista, New Parliament, and Central Secretariat.
●	
BIM is now being extensively utilised and leveraged by some ministries and departments 
like the National Capital Region Transport Corporation, all metro rails, select complex 
industrial and tourism projects, various airports, along with organisation-wise 
acceptance at Central Public Works Department and extensive digitalisation in the 
form of Data Lake across NHAI that is now being extended to entire Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways.

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
12.63.	 As the different sections in this Chapter show, there has been a quantum jump in 
infrastructure build-up in the last five years. However, there are some areas for corrective and 
collective actions, as presented in this section.
12.64.	 Land Related: Despite the large build-up of connectivity infrastructure and energy-
related assets, both the sectors reported the need for corrections in the delay in land acquisition, 
and land-related clearances. Issues are also raised about slow on-boarding of digital land 
records. In the case of airport development, greenfield airport projects are time-intensive due 
to the need for appropriate site selection, land acquisition and necessary approvals. Addressing 
challenges related to land in physical infrastructure requires coordinated action at different 
tiers of the Government. 
12.65.	 Skill Demands: The aviation sector highlighted that technical knowledge for the 
development of segments such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations and 
manufacturing are concentrated with a limited number of original equipment manufacturers. 
The airline industry is a highly competitive segment, susceptible to external shocks such as 
oil prices, exchange rates, epidemics, wars, and equipment issues. These shocks can affect 
the operations of an airline and impact its viability, hence the development of capabilities in 
segments such as MRO, leasing and skilling are needed to further support the airlines. Many 
aspects related to project development, feasibility assessment, financial return analysis and 
different stages of project management, in the case of infrastructure projects, involve specialised 
technical skills that need to be nurtured based on systematic need assessment. Effective public-
private participation is essential for this. 

Infrastructure
441
12.66.	 Need to improve private participation: The addition to the stock of infrastructure 
in the last five years owed predominantly to public sector financing. Private sector participation 
is not forthcoming to the extent desired. Literature suggests that many factors are impeding 
private participation in infrastructure building. Some of the important ones are the following:
a.	 Lumpy capital investment and long payback period and difficulty in mobilising large equity 
and debt at affordable cost. Many novel PPP financing models like hybrid annuity model, 
have been introduced to mitigate this constraint. But private sector participation through 
these modes has so far been limited to only certain sectors like roads and water. 
b.	 Project structuring issues related to risk estimation, allocation and mitigation 
c.	 Delays in getting clearances and land acquisition
d.	 Lack of an independent regulator for infrastructural sectors, etc.
e.	 Contractual issues and inadequate arrangements for dispute resolution and arbitration, 
leading to prolonged litigation.
12.67.	 The question of climate and environmental sustainability is increasingly 
becoming important in infrastructure building as discussed in the sections on physical 
connectivity and energy infrastructure. An emerging challenge for the aviation sector would 
be compliance with mandatory phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation (CORSIA) from 2027. Since India is a Member State of ICAO, obligated 
to comply with offsetting requirements i.e., either use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or offset 
their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved emissions unit programmes. 
However, there are no ICAO-approved emissions unit programmes in India to supply CORSIA-
eligible emissions units, to meet the offsetting requirements of airline operators. The cost of 
SAF is almost 3 to 5 times the cost of fossil ATF depending on the feedstock and pathway used 
for the production of SAF29.
12.68.	 Lack of aggregation of financial flows into infrastructure: Infrastructure 
financing structure is complex with the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including all tiers 
of the Government, public sector enterprises, commercial banks and non-banking financial 
companies, special purpose vehicles, capital market players, development financial institutions 
and foreign investors. The instruments of resource mobilisation are many, i.e., credit, bonds, 
equities, hybrid instruments like mutual funds, foreign capital inflows and instruments like 
InvITs and REITS. The following are some issues that merit attention:
a.	 A common issue is about different reporting formats and sectoral splits followed in 
different sources of financing. The detailed information required for the Central and State 
Governments can be obtained from the object heads of expenditure maintained by the 
CGA and C&AG. However, such detailed information on sectoral financial flows is hard to

in a different format than the capital market flows, external commercial borrowings and 
FDI data. The periodicity of reporting, and even the definition of the term ‘infrastructure’

employed are also different. Some data, like the data on bank credit, are available only as 
an outstanding figure on a particular date.
b.	 Among the Government sources, the available information on the capital expenditure by 
the local self-governments is inadequate. The city finance portal of MoHUA is an important 
source of information on the finances of urban self-governments. Likewise, the eGramSwaraj 
portal, maintained by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is an emerging source on the finances 
of rural self-governments. However, the information on capital expenditure, with sectoral 
split, is not available in good shape from these portals. 
c.	 The information on budgetary support by State Governments to State public sector 
enterprises (SPSEs) is available in the C&AG reports. However, there is no ready source of 
information on the fund flow from SPSEs to infrastructure sectors.
d.	 One exhaustive source of information on the capital expenditure by the private corporations 
(and public sector enterprises) is the MCA database. However, expansive data filings by 
companies become available only with a lag, which also require rigorous consistency checks 
before attempting any aggregation. 
e.	 There are several forms of flow of funds between different infrastructure financing sources, 
which makes a simple aggregation of all sources largely meaningless. Such financial flows 
occur between different tiers of the Government, between Governments and their public 
enterprises, between banks and NBFCs, etc. Hence, avoiding double counting of financial 
flows requires careful scrutiny of different datasets.
12.69.	 Lack of total picture of physical progress in infrastructure projects: The 
last decade witnessed earnest efforts on the part of the Government to build institutions and 
structures that monitor progress in infrastructure and disentangle bottlenecks. A discussion on 
these measures follows this section. However, there is no single source that gives an inventory of 
infrastructure projects in the country, undertaken at different levels so as to evaluate progress 
sectorally and sub-sectorally vis-à-vis corresponding targets. Overcoming this limitation 
involves coordination of central, state and the third tiers of the Government working with 
project authorities, including public sector enterprises and private partners.

National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)
12.70.	 The portal provides opportunities for Ministries and States/UTs to collate all major 
infrastructure projects at a single location, thus acting as a centralised portal to track and 
review project progress across all economic and social infrastructure sub-sectors. The portal 
also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcase investment opportunities to national 
and international investors.
12.71.	 The Government launched the NIP with a forward-looking approach and with a  
projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide high-
quality infrastructure across the country30. NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than 
₹100 crore each covering greenfield and brownfield investments. As of 12 April 2024, out of

of 58 per cent, followed by the energy sector at 24 per cent, and the water and sanitation 
sector at 12 per cent, and balance five per cent by other sectors such as social infrastructure,  
communication, etc.
12.72.	 NIP currently has over 9,666 projects and schemes covering 37 sub-sectors (as on 12th 
April 2024) that are hosted and monitored through the India Investment Grid (NIP-PMG) 
integrated portal. Out of these projects, 4,413 projects (46 per cent) are under implementation 
while 2,062 projects (21 per cent) have been completed.

allows project proponents to raise issues with concerned the Government agencies that are 
causing hindrances in the implementation of projects.
12.74.	 PMG has facilitated resolution of 6,867 issues in 1,443 projects worth ₹46.1 lakh crore. 
The PMG portal has on-boarded 2,457 projects worth ₹62.5 lakh crore until March 2024 which 
consist of all important mega infrastructure projects including high-impact PM GatiShakti 
projects and critical infrastructure gap projects.

PMGS-NMP has been adopted at the State and Centre level to assess last-mile connectivity 
gaps and ensure seamless movement of people and goods. This is a transformative approach for 
planning multimodal infrastructure connectivity to economic nodes, thereby bringing logistics 
efficiency.

Box XII.25: Implementation of NLP gains steam
lndia’s focus on improving logistics infrastructure has led to an improvement of six places 
from 44 in 2018 to 38 in 2023 out of 139 countries in the Logistics Performance lndex of the 
World Bank.

Economic Survey 2023-24

National Logistics Policy (NLP) was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGS-
NMP i.e., to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, 
and cost-effective logistics network by leveraging best-in-class technology, and processes. 
The aim is to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, 
and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem. 
NLP is being implemented through a comprehensive logistics action plan. The progress 
under each of these action areas is below:
i.	 Integrated Digital Logistics Systems: 
	
●	 Unified Logistics Integrated Platform, a single window platform, integrating 36 
logistics-related digital systems/portals across eight Ministries and providing real-
time information on 1,800 data fields has been developed. 
	
●	 For tracking 100 per cent of India’s containerised EXIM cargo, a Logistics Data Bank 
has been developed which uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), IoT, and Big 
data analytics and is integrated with 28 port terminals of India, over 95 toll plazas, 
407 container freight station/inland container depot and empty yards, 56 SEZs, 
three integrated check posts. 
ii.	 Service Quality Standards: An e-book has been developed on warehousing standards 
delineating existing standards issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards and Warehouse 
Development and Regulatory Authority. 
iii.	Capacity Building: Training courses on logistics and PMGS-NMP are being integrated 
with central and state training institutes. 
iv.	 State engagement: States are developing State Logistics Plans aligned with NLP to 
give policy focus at the State level. 26 States have notified their State Logistics policies. 
An annual “Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS)” survey is also deployed in 
all State and Union Territories.
v.	 EXIM Logistics: To streamline EXIM logistics, infrastructure gaps are addressed 
through action plans developed by the National Committee on Trade Facilitation 
(NCTF). NCTF Working Groups formulated a National Trade Facilitation Action Plan 
2020-23. The action plan for 2024-26 is being developed.
vi.	 Services Improvement Framework: The Service Improvement Group has been 
established with the involvement of over 30 business associations. Critical issues are 
raised by associations on the E-LoGS platform.
vii.	Sectoral Plans for Efficient Logistics: This aims to address the needs and challenges 
in the logistics sector, particularly of bulk and breakbulk cargo. Coal Logistics Plan and 
Policy was launched in February 2024. Comprehensive Port Connectivity Plan was 
prepared in 2022 that identified 107 port projects to strengthen connectivity between 
ports, railways, roadways, and inland waterways.
viii. Facilitation of Development of Logistics Park: Guidelines for Multi-Modal 
Logistics Park are being reviewed.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
12.77.	 Transformative changes have dawned upon the infrastructure landscape of India in 
the last decade in terms of facilitative institutional architecture and the quality and stock of 
infrastructure assets. The consistent focus on road, rail and air connectivity, sanitation and 
digital infrastructure have brought in a considerable growth in assets in these sectors. 
12.78.	 However, infrastructure-creation efforts in India are predominantly public sector-led. 
As per the Infrastructure Monitor 2023 published by Global Infrastructure Hub and the World 
Bank, India’s investment in infrastructure was largely funded by the public sector – which 
includes the Government agencies and state-owned entities and banks31. Between fiscal year 
2019 and 2023, the Central and State Governments contributed to 49 per cent and 29 per cent 
of the total investments, respectively, while the private sector contributed 22 per cent32. 
12.79.	 For India to continue down the path of building quality infrastructure, a higher level of 
private sector financing and resource mobilisation from new sources will be crucial. Facilitating 
this would not only require policy and institutional support from the Central Government, 
but State and Local Governments would have to play an equally important role. International 
experience shows us how initiatives at the sub-national level can facilitate resource mobilisation 
for infrastructure development. Examples include pooled financing mechanisms for municipal 
projects33, specialised municipal intermediaries34, asset recycling programs35, tax increment 
financing36 and land sales and development rights37 among other innovative approaches. Each 
of the measures witnessed broad-based implementation, succeeding in mobilising finances for 
critical infrastructure projects. 
12.80.	 As mentioned above, there is a need to improve data capture and reporting mechanisms 
for investments in infrastructure across instruments and sectors as well its composition across 
different projects on a granular level. The Rangarajan Commission Report on Infrastructure 
Statistics (2001) had underscored the importance of collecting and maintaining a reliable 
statistical database for the infrastructure sector. Major strides have been made since then to 
collect data on policy direction, institutional strength, project performance and monitoring. 
However, data gaps persist in some key areas.

a.	 Existing databases fall short on assessing the demand for infrastructure and tracking the 
utilisation of facilities built in the sub-sectors. Demand aggregation can provide an insight 
into the appetite for infrastructure projects based on sub-sectors and regions, while the 
construction of an index that tracks the utilisation rates would shed light on sub-sectors 
where there is either an oversupply or shortfall of required infrastructure facilities. 
Addressing these two gaps can provide additional diagnostic measures for enabling 
policymakers and other stakeholders to optimally allocate scarce resources.
b.	 Currently, statistics on the infrastructure sector can be derived from several available 
databases such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline, the PPP India Portal, heads of 
budget accounts and reports of the respective infrastructure focused ministries, fund flows 
of Central and State Public Sector Enterprises and financial flows to the infrastructure 
sector from Non-Governmental institutions such as Banks, NBFCs and the Capital Markets. 
These databases are useful to assess infrastructure statistics at the project level and to track 
financial flows at the sectoral level. However, when attempting to assess infrastructure 
spending and development across time based on the Harmonized List (HML) classifications 
for a macro-level overview, these databases fall short due to the lack of consistency in the 
frequency of data collection, lack of uniformity in the methodology followed and cross fund 
flows between institutions which can lead to double counting. This also makes comparing 
data from different sources difficult. Therefore, going forward, it would be useful if a 
mechanism is developed for consolidating infrastructure development and financial flow 
data from various sources, as per the HML classification, under a single access point which 
is updated at a regular frequency. It would also be of use to policymakers if the consolidated 
statistics are recorded with the public and private sector bifurcation.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
INDIA: WHY WE MUST 
LOOK AT THE PROBLEM 
THROUGH OUR LENS
Addressing anthropogenic climate change has emerged as the top global priority, with 
multilateral bodies, experts, and the media calling for nations worldwide to do their 
part in mitigating a ‘climate catastrophe’ before it’s too late. India, having partaken 
in the collective effort, has made major strides over the last decade, yet continues to 
be labelled as one of the largest polluters in the world and is frequently chastised for 
not doing enough. However, the criticisms of the Indian approach fail to recognise 
two critical points. One, India is faced with balancing economic development along 
with meaningful climate action akin to its developing peers, and second, the proposed 
solutions to climate change, which serve as the basis for criticising India, ignore how 
sustainable living is built into the Indian lifestyle. 
Rooted in the principles of sustenance, India’s ethos emphasises a harmonious 
relationship with nature, which is in sharp contrast to the overconsumption prevalent 
in other parts of the developed world. Solutions to address climate change are based 
on the principles of a market society, which seeks to substitute the means to achieve 
overconsumption rather than addressing overconsumption itself. Such an approach 
thus gives importance to the label under which their lifestyle can continue instead of 
bringing about a change in their lifestyle. 
Over the years, this has produced a slew of policies that have unintended consequences 
for the planet, resulting in little or no reduction in carbon emissions. If India, with its 
large population, chooses to go down this path, the climate consequences for the country 
and the world will be hugely negative. Therefore, India needs to follow its own path and 
look at the problem through its own lens if the nation is to empower its citizens through 
economic development while simultaneously addressing the issue of climate change.
These considerations served as the foundation for Mission LiFE, a unique initiative 
announced by the Hon’ble Prime Minister at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference. 
Mission LiFE seeks to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against 
climate change. Deriving its principles from ancient Indian philosophy, the tenets of this 
approach are based on making pro-planet choices without compromising on quality of 
life. It is about making deliberate choices in the present while remaining conscious of 
the generations to come. Mission LiFE seeks to address the ‘wants’ of the people without 
letting them hurt Nature.

INTRODUCTION
Mata Bhumi Putroham Prithivyah
Earth is my mother and I am her son
13.1.	 Sustenance is at the core of Indian ethos. This principle underlies our relationship with 
Nature, with other people, with materiality, and within ourselves. Recognising and buttressing 
such ethos is important in today’s world since India now comes face to face with it in a shiny 
new wrapper and a limited scope, ironically mandated from the part of the world that has 
otherwise relied on overconsumption as a pathway to growth.  As the clamour for sustainability 
resonates across the world, India finds itself surprised at the crossroads of having to address 
economically, what it has always believed and practised philosophically.
13.2.	As the world’s most populous country, currently globally the 5th largest economy, India 
is headed to become the 3rd largest by 2030.  Naturally, this means that our energy needs are 
expected to grow - about 1.5 times faster than the global average in the next 30 years1. Instead 
of appreciating the task at hand and the achievements already made by the country (Box 1), 
India is being called one of the largest polluters2, and hectored to do more even as a significant 
portion of the world does less.
Box XIII.1: India’s achievements against targets for climate change
•	
Successfully reduced the emission intensity vis-à-vis its GDP by 33% between 2005 and 
2019, thus achieving the initial NDC target for 2030, 11 years ahead of scheduled time.
•	
Also achieved 40% of electric installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources, nine 
years ahead of the target for 2030. Between 2017 and 2023, India has added around 100 
GW of installed electric capacity, of which around 80% is attributed to non-fossil fuel-
based resources.
•	
India’s contribution to climate action is significant through its international efforts - 
International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), 
creation of LeadIT, Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), and Big Cat Alliance.
13.3.	With Climate Change as the new North Star for the world, it is now well-established 
that 196 countries must meet their individual commitments under ‘Nationally Determined 
Contributions’ towards reducing carbon emissions ‘to limit the global temperature increase to 
1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels’3. Since globally all efforts hover on channelling 
precious resources towards attaining this artificial golden mean, with little clear idea of what 
happens if it doesn’t, it naturally begets the question – ‘Is the strategy adopted, both optimum 
and in everyone’s interest?’
13.4.	This essay purports to examine this peculiar situation under three sections – assessment 
of global pathways to achieve climate change goals, inherent dissonance in the global strategy,

and the need for a complementary but more sustainable strategy centred on key tenets of 
existence (Mission LiFE).
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE GLOBAL APPROACH
13.5.	 As the literature goes, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide 
(CO2), primarily contribute to adverse climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC)4 paints a dire picture - emissions pose a serious threat since CO2, once 
released into the atmosphere, can hang for 300 to 1000 years5, causing global warming and 
environmental destruction such as the melting of polar ice caps.  
13.6.	To achieve the stated objectives, the world has adopted a strategy that comprises a 
set of pathways, popularly called ‘climate adaptation’ and ‘climate mitigation’. Most of this 
includes shifting to energy sources other than fossil fuels, enhancing energy efficiency through 
innovative and environment-friendly design, adopting regenerative and environmentally 
sensitive agricultural practices, as well as protecting and restoring the natural ecosystems (See 
Box XIII.2).
Box XIII.2: WEO-2023 proposes a global strategy for getting the world on track by  2030
The Five Key Pillars to this proposal include:
•	
Tripling global Renewable Energy Capacity.
•	
Doubling the rate of Energy Efficiency improvements.
•	
Slashing methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by 75 per cent.
•	
Innovative, large-scale financing mechanisms to triple clean energy investments in 
emerging and developing economies. 
•	
Measures to ensure an orderly decline in the use of fossil fuels, including an end to new 
approvals of unabated coal-fired power plants.
WHY IS THE CURRENT APPROACH FLAWED?
13.7.	 To inform the design of emission-limiting pathways, IPCC has quantified the remaining 
carbon space available as the “carbon budget.” As per their estimates, from the beginning of 
2020, the world has approximately 500 GtCO2 left for a target of 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for 
a target of 2°C (with a likelihood of 50% and 67%, respectively). With each passing year, the 
budget gets smaller, and the time available to act slips away. Nations are then expected to 
commit to “accelerated and equitable mitigation pathways” while walking the tightrope of 
developmental demands. The alarmism sounds quite dreadful, with the IPCC stating, “there 
is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for 
4  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) states, “Human-caused 
climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes. This has led to widespread adverse 
impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society”. The half-life of CO2 and a stock 
of the damage already caused has thus given rise to a need for collective action if we are to limit temperature rises 
and the consequent environmental damage.

all”.  Such forebodings notwithstanding, the purported climate solution has some fundamental 
issues.
Little principled understanding of laws of Life
13.8.	Life exists only in the form as we know it today. Hence, any strategy that aims to confuse 
man-made actions as entire solutions by themselves is extremely short-sighted in nature. 
Ultimately, we cannot ignore the reality that we come from nature, and the systems required 
for life must necessarily be linked to the organic flow of nature and life. No artificial mechanism 
is a workable system in its entirety because as much as we can ingeniously tinker with 
manufacturing processes, two simple principles stand paramount- 1) Humans cannot create 
a new element, cannot change any law of nature, and cannot synthesise a process that doesn’t 
take or release to the environment. 2) Fundamentals of existence remain the same eternally. 
This means humans will continue to want oxygen, water, and food in the form we know it. Yet, 
we continue to disrupt the same for both us and other species. That’s why the adopted strategy 
for addressing climate change suffers from foundational issues. 
13.9.	Climate change strategies continue to be prescriptive in the acceptable mandates for 
geographically, economically, and climatically different countries. Without cross-learning, 
many natural ideas relevant to sustainable development, such as consumption patterns, 
lifestyles, plant vs meat-based diet, etc., are not factored in. 
13.10.	 Globally, Power and Transport industries have the maximum contribution to GHG 
emissions, followed by Industrial combustion, Agriculture, and Waste industries. Of the latter, 
Beef production has the highest emissions per kilogram of food product as seen in Tab XIII.1. 
Despite this, there is not even a call for change, let alone a mandate.

13.11.	The entire developed world uses toilet paper made of ‘virgin wood’ for the most regular 
body activity, every single day, multiple times over. One of the best global sustainability blogs 
‘TreeHugger’ states that ‘Making one single roll of toilet paper uses 1.5 pounds of wood6, 37 
gallons of water and 1.3 kWh of electricity. Many Asian countries provide valuable lessons 
around these, yet their non-capitalist strategies often remain excluded from mainstream discussions 
because Behavioural and Lifestyle Change seems to be more difficult than Climate Change.
13.12.	 Man, and Nature (gross forms of Purush and Prakriti in the Samkhya Tradition) are 
indestructible entities that interact to provide meaning to consciousness in the form of reality 
as we know it. Hence, any strategy that aims to alter things far beyond the comprehension or 
control of man, such as ensuring that the planet’s temperature doesn’t cross 2 degrees Celsius, 
must travel the journey inwards and not outwards.
Ignores the interconnected nature of existence
13.13.	 Climate is nature’s reality so inherently interconnected in ways that science hasn’t even 
discovered its nuances. Surprisingly, our accepted pathways seem to ignore this unmissable 
reality to focus on siloed solutions, unintegrated with natural value chains. A case in point is 
the substitution of energy – to renewables from fossil fuels.
13.14.	 There is hardly any inequivalence foundationally between extracting earth for one 
resource over another. Solar panels may generate renewable energy, but solar batteries are 
formed of materials extracted from the earth’s crust7, particularly Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, and 
some rare earth minerals8.  According to some estimates9, this not only leaves ‘large scars in 
the landscape’ but requires substantial water, releasing about 15 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of 
mineral10. Bringing the extracted ore to usable forms requires heat between 800-1000 degrees 
Celsius11, temperatures that can, ironically, be cost-effectively brought out by only burning 
fossil fuels (Chart XIII.2).
13.15.	 Cobalt and Copper, used extensively in Li-ion batteries, electric vehicles, and mobile 
phones, have a raging sustainability crisis at the heart of their extraction. About four-fifths of 
the world’s cobalt supply is buried deep within a single country that is also one of the world’s 
poorest – the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter referred to as Congo). About 80% of 
the country’s cobalt production is controlled by Chinese companies who refine in China, and 
subsequently sell to battery manufacturers globally. Siddharth Kara, a fellow at Harvard’s T.H 
Chan School of Public Health, states in his book ‘Cobalt Red’ that much of Congo’s Cobalt 
extraction is done by “artisanal miners’’ – a new-age euphemistic term for freelance workers 
6  Stop Using Toiler Paper; Get the Blue Bidet, Treehugger, October 2018 (https://tinyurl.com/3rmjz8kn)
7  Most of the minerals extracted are from hard rock mines or underground brine reservoirs through a process that 
requires energy generated from CO2-emitting fossil fuels. 
8  Some of the magnets used in their production comprise rare earth minerals like neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) 
and samarium cobalt (SmCo). They are not ‘rare’ in the actual sense of the word but abundant in the earth’s crust. 
However, since they occur in relatively low concentrations in the ores compared to other normally extractable 
metals, they pose significant difficulty in mining and refining, which again does huge damage to the environment.

who work in dangerous mines for the equivalent of few dollars a day12. It is sad and ironical that 
all of this is done in the name of sustainable electric vehicles, which may contain up to 3.5 times 
as much copper as a gas powered cars13.

13.16.	 The generative value chain of ‘clean energy’ products such as solar panels and windmills, 
stretching from mining to manufacturing to transportation to use to the last stage of disposal, 
has similar emission effects as other fuels would, depending on material and distances travelled. 
Additionally, it consists of the disruption of existing supply chains made over decades and 
creating new pathways involving monumental environmental externalities such as emissions 
during extraction, transportation, the establishment of new factories involving new land, 
machinery production, and ancillary development, transportation of mobile renewable units to 
individual consumers, rendering existing infrastructure and pathways redundant.  
13.17.	 For example – switching to EVs requires uprooting the existing network of petrol pumps 
and creating a new network of charging stations involving all of the above. Unfortunately, all 
of these “hidden costs” – both from a monetary, and an environmental perspective are not 
accounted for in the lifecycle costs when advocating for the displacement of fossil fuels with 
renewable options. Their greatest ‘climate-friendly’ emission control rests only in end-user 
emissions, which makes the comparison of climate costs across the options incomparable.
13.18.	 There is not enough research on how much the end-to-end lifecycle costs. Land is finite, 
but demand is not. Solar can need 300 times as much space as nuclear, and biomass more than 
8,000 times14. At the same time, wind turbine blades and solar panels have to be replaced every

waste issues, the main challenge preventing swift transition is that solar and wind power are 
only cheaper than fossil fuels when the sun shines and the wind blows. Industrialisation and 
development require power and energy 24/7. Even factoring in four hours of storage makes 
solar and wind go from the cheapest power available to much more expensive than gas and coal 
power (Chart XIII.3).

13.19.	 Moreover, to provide firmly reliable power, studies15 show that a 100% solar and wind 
system would need a large storage capacity, which is impossibly expensive. Overall, there are 
critical sustainability issues connected to the production of wind turbines, solar photovoltaic 
modules, electric vehicles, and lithium-ion batteries, such as the use of conflict minerals, 
toxicity, limited availability or supply chain governance issues of rare earth elements, cobalt & 
lithium16. What the strategy excludes is indeed as noteworthy as what it includes.
Insufficient for the ordained purpose
13.20.	 In normal parlance, energy and power are often used interchangeably. However, their 
difference is another factor that makes climate change strategy a difficult one to follow. Matthew 
L Wald, an independent energy analyst, says in ‘The Myth of Solar Power’: 
“In November 2022, France passed a law requiring that all parking lots with 80 spaces or 
more install roofs with solar panels to cover at least half the spaces. According to estimates, 
the initiative will result in 11 GW of power—an amount, Grist gleefully reported, that would 
be enough to power 8 million homes. In fact, it’s enough to power zero homes.
If you have a small rooftop solar panel that can generate 50 watts of power, it wouldn’t 
matter how long the generator runs for or how much energy it produces and stores—on a

very sunny day in Arizona in the summer, for example, it might be able to produce 300 watt-
hours, or 0.3 kilowatt-hours, over a 24-hour period—at any given moment, it would only be 
able to power two of the lightbulbs.”
13.21.	 Vaclav Smil goes so far as to say in a 48-page report17 published by Fraser Institute, 
“Net Zero Carbon is a highly unlikely outcome”.
“In terms of final energy uses and specific energy converters, the unfolding transition would 
have to replace more than 4 terawatts (TW) of electricity-generating capacity now installed 
in large coal- and gas-fired stations by converting to non-carbon sources; to substitute 
nearly 1.5 billion combustion (gasoline and diesel) engines in road and off-road vehicles; to 
convert all agricultural and crop processing machinery (including about 50 million tractors 
and more than 100 million irrigation pumps); to find new sources of heat, hot air, and hot 
water used in a wide variety of industrial processes (from iron smelting and cement and glass 
making to chemical syntheses and food preservation) that now consume close to 30 percent 
of all final uses of fossil fuels; to replace more than half a billion natural gas furnaces now 
heating houses and industrial, institutional, and commercial places with heat pumps or other 
sources of heat; and to find new ways to power nearly 120,000 merchant fleet vessels (bulk 
carriers of ores, cement, fertilizers, wood and grain, and container ships, the largest one with 
capacities of some 24,000 units, now running mostly on heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel) and 
nearly 25,000 active jetliners that form the foundation of global long-distance transportation 
(fuelled by kerosene)... On the face of it, and even without performing any informed technical 
and economic analyses, this seems to be an impossible task given that:
•	
We have only a single generation (about 25 years) to do it;
•	
We have not even reached the peak of global consumption of fossil fuels;
•	
The peak will not be followed by precipitous declines;
•	
We still have not deployed any zero-carbon large-scale commercial processes to produce 
essential materials;
•	
The electrification has, at the end of 2022, converted only about 2 per cent of passenger 
vehicles (more than 40 million) to different varieties of battery-powered cars, and that 
decarbonisation is yet to affect heavy road transport, shipping, and flying.
Earth has enough for needs but not for greed
13.22.	 The current Climate Change strategy seems to say that given that our energy needs will 
continue to rise, we must try replacing conventional fuel with renewables and clean energy – 
thus making it a substitution issue rather than a global lifestyle issue. This replacement must be 
done only in the way we know – through swapping of one preferred industry to another, through 
the creation of new transportation and supply lines in place of existing ones, to penalising the 
low-emitters with disproportionately higher payments.
13.23.	 What this strategy doesn’t do is attack the root of the problem – overconsumption, 
which is starker among developed countries. Moreover, do each of us really need multiple 
screens, even if they are charged by renewable energy sources, or must everyone fly off to

a fancy destination in fancy planes for a great conversation on reducing climate impact, or 
that we must eat for taste what we shouldn’t eat for health or environment.  As Derek Bower 
says in FT18, “If we want oil companies to stop selling fossil fuels, we should consume less of 
them and we should vote for governments that make them more expensive, not less. Yes, our 
physical infrastructure has been built over decades around petroleum use. Yes, oil companies 
have lobbied forever to preserve this arrangement and slow down alternatives. But no one is 
compelling those of us in the rich world to fly so much, drive Escalades, devour so much meat, 
or buy so much stuff.”  
13.24.	 It doesn’t encourage a genuine cathartic approach to nature but instead focuses on 
creating another industry out of sustainability – instead of imbibing sustainable practices 
in the way we live, we worry more about carrying PETA labels on our bags. The fact of the 
matter is organisations, people, and countries are less bothered about ensuring virtuosity in the 
process of production than about getting a “Fair Trade” global label in the fear of being shut out 
of premium places. This exclusive club does not question the drive towards overconsumption 
– more energy, more video entertainment, more houses, more transportation but questions 
the labels under which this happens. That is the hypocrisy in-built under the modern climate 
change strategy.
Global pursuit of energy-guzzling technologies
13.25.	 On the one hand, developing nations are forcefully nudged to sign up for climate 
commitments that they are not ready for. On the other hand, the developed world is in a mad 
‘Scramble for Africa’ kind of rush to usher in the latest and the most expansive AI (Artificial 
Intelligence) ecosystem. The fact is that AI is an energy guzzler. Even as the data centres are 
ramping up energy demand, cloud storage facilities, crypto mining, and AI are all expected to 
increase this exponentially (Chart XIII.4).

13.26.	 As per a broad estimate by the International Energy Agency, a single Chat-GPT search 
consumes 10 times more energy than a similar query on Google. One large data centre in Iowa 
owned by Meta is estimated to burn just in one year, the equivalent of 7 million laptops working 
8 hours a day19. FT reports that power demand from data centres globally could reach up to 
1,000 TWh by 2026 (Chart XIII.4). To put this figure in perspective - Germany’s and France’s 
net power demand today is roughly around 500 TWh each respectively20. Elon Musk, most 
famously said recently at Bosch Connected World Conference, “I've never seen any technology 
advance faster than this. The chip shortage may be behind us, but AI and EVs are expanding at 
such a rapacious rate that the world will face supply crunches in electricity and transformers 
next year”. By 2034, global energy consumption by data centres is expected to top 1,580 TWh, 
about as much as is used by all of India21.
13.27.	 This electricity demand is rising more exponentially than green energy production can 
keep pace with. Already, there seems to be a movement to push away green commitments and 
delay retiring of some coal-fired plants – in the Salt Lake City region, a coal plant retirement has 
been pushed back by a decade to 2042 and another delayed to 2036. While there are talks by 
tech leaders of attempting nuclear fusion startups to power the tech’s Bakasur22  -like hunger, 
practically, it seems to be much farther away in the future, given that the solution is not yet 
viable.
13.28.	 The incompatibility of the two major movements of AI and Green energy being pushed 
by the West is not unseen by the global world. It seems like little thought has been put into the 
inevitable discordance in the chosen economic and sustainable strategies.
Pretends to be data-driven but is shy of per-person data
13.29.	 It is said that India is the 3rd largest emitter after the US and China and, therefore, is 
repeatedly asked to accept a greater share of responsibility.  What is constantly de-emphasised is 
that since the period of the first settlement of societies, western nations with a forward position 
on the industrial revolution indulged in fossil-fuelled development with reckless abandon that 
led to the position the world is in today.  Despite advocacy by developing nations on this, a 
sanitised reference to ‘historical emissions’ is submerged deep within abstruse literature and 
is met with a casual indifference towards its real role and impact on the emerging countries’ 
climate targets.  Even copious amounts of data inundation cannot change a basic fact: energy is 
a per-capita phenomenon. To put it simply:
Energy Consumption (at time T) = Energy consumed by 1 person (E1) * Number of people (N) 
+ Energy consumed by common activities required for N (EN)

13.30.	  Because all modern policy-making starts from baseline assessment, it is essential that 
the climate target for each country is proportional to its economic status. On the contrary, it 
is observed that the top 10% of the per-capita emitters averaged 22 tonnes of CO2 in 2021, 
which is over 200 times what the bottom 10 % emits23. 85% of the current largest emitters live 
in advanced economies like the US, Europe, and China, and the bottom 10% of emitters live in 
developing countries of Africa and South Asia where even access to electricity is a challenge24. 
Illustrating this stark difference in per-capita consumption and emissions, the Economist 
highlights that the average African consumes 185 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year while Europe 
and the United States consume 6500 kWh and 12700 kWh, respectively25. On the contrary, 
India’s historical cumulative emissions and per capita emissions are very low despite being 
home to more than 17% of the global population – contributing only about 4% of the global 
cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019 (Chart XIII.5).

though global comparison of countries uses data such as per-capita income or per-capita 
consumption, the same is not followed while assessing energy emissions, even when it is directly 
dependent on per-person use. Countries assumed to be ‘greener’ by various international 
indices turn a dark shade of brown when the filter of per capita is applied.

13.32.	 Comparatively, India’s per capita emissions have consistently remained low between 
2.5 and 2.8 Tons CO2eq/ year, despite substantial economic growth over the last decade. Per 
capita emissions of EU27 nations (8 Tons CO2eq/ year)26 were almost 3 times that of India. 
Even in the three scenarios for demand estimation employed by World Energy Outlook 2023, 
it was reported that the ‘per-capita energy demand of emerging countries remains well below 
that of developed countries, even by 2030’27. A point that casually falls through the crevices in 
the discussions around climate change.
13.33.	 With such extreme disparities and large and persistent inequalities in historical and 
current global energy consumption, the targets and strategies for the attainment of zero 
emissions should not be dictated or mandated. It is important for countries to take ownership 
of the climate problem and work through a collaborative approach for meaningful climate 
action, unencumbered by external pressure or excessive criticism.
Historical Blindspot and a surprising lack of Guilt
13.34.	 Globally, there seems to be a tendency to overburden oneself with the need to set right 
today, the wrongs of the past. This is also complemented by a moralistic angle taken by the 
developed world on governance and policy towards countries with different understandings, 
including sustainability. However, in the case of climate change, where the data is as clear as 
26  Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, GHG Emissions of all world countries 2023 Report

by 7% in the APS (Announced Pledges Scenario) and by 15% in the NZE (Net Zero Emissions) Scenario. In 
advanced economies, per capita demand declines in all scenarios to 2030. In emerging market and developing 
economies, it continues to rise in the STEPS as economic growth drives an increase in energy services demand.”

chalk and cheese, the origin of the problem and the actual privilege enjoyed for a large number 
of decades (exploiting resources with a gay abandon to achieve economic progress) are also 
ignored. As Alice says in her Wonderland28, “But that's just the trouble with me. I give myself 
very good advice, but I very seldom follow it.’’
13.35.	 A significant disparity in energy access and carbon footprints can be observed among 
developed and developing countries. While developed nations have built their infrastructure 
at a leisurely, uninterrupted pace, many countries in Africa and South Asia are still striving 
to achieve regular electricity supply in urban areas. About 55 per cent of the population in 
least-developed countries still lack access to electricity29. Research alludes that high-income 
countries use 6 times more resources and generate 10 times larger climate impacts than low-
income countries.30 This disparity makes it unfair to have a single deadline for zero emissions 
across countries.
13.36.	 Low- and middle-income countries face triple threats in terms of increasing energy 
demand, unaffordable costs of clean technologies, and a deep dependence on fossil fuels. 
This calls for a genuine recognition by developed nations of their historical contribution to 
environmental degradation and transfer of resources, technology, as well as technical capacity 
to developing countries which helps in closing the financing gap and progressing towards the 
shared goal of combating climate change.
Inadequate climate financing
13.37.	 The West turns a March Hare31 - I have an excellent idea! Let's change the subject - 
every time the subject of real climate financing due to historical reparations comes into play.  
Research shows that developing countries require ~USD 6 trillion by 2030 to achieve just about 
half of their existing NDC targets. Against this, only USD 100 billion was pledged by developed 
countries till 202032, of which only USD 83.3 billion was provided33. This level of financing still 
does not match up to the scale of the challenge faced – climate adaptation needs of developing 
countries are expected to reach USD 300 billion by 2030 and USD 500 billion by 205034, which 
is 5-10 times greater than the current fund flows.
13.38.	 Robert Burns in his poem says “There is no such uncertainty as a sure thing”. The 
surety of such climate pledges looks far more problematic once the lens is zoomed. Most of the 
current funding comprises loans to middle-income countries that are already struggling with 
heavy public debt burdens to meet their essential service requirements. Over two-thirds of the 
climate finance received by middle-income countries between 2015 and 2020 was in the form 
of loans35. Moreover, profits and returns on investments are often prioritised over long-term

environmental sustainability during fund allocation.
13.39.	 They say the devil lies in the details. Under the golden wrapper of a committed USD100bn 
financing, the elves are at work polishing the quirks, as is evidenced in this small fact reported 
by Hindustan Times36 - At the Cartagena Ad Hoc Work Programme (AHWP) talks — in the run-
up to the actual negotiations at the Conference of Parties (CoP) — the United States and other 
western countries have reportedly pushed to make the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) 
contributions “voluntary” for those who “choose to pay”. They have also advocated widening 
the pool of contributors to include developing nations based on the latter’s “economic realities” 
and “current emission share”. So, the reason behind this vacillation on ‘Who’s to pay’ is well-
indicated through Box XIII.3.
Box XIII.3: Willingness to Change and Willingness to pay for 
Environmentally Sustainable Policies
One would imagine that given most of the climate sustainability debate largely stems from 
the developed world, they would be the first ones to accept the financial impact of changing 
their consumption-oriented lifestyle. However, research says otherwise. Almost 63% of 
respondents of the OECD Environmental Policies and Individual Behaviour Change Survey 
in 2022 (administered to over 17,000 households) feel that sustainable choices should not 
impact them financially and therefore ‘they are unwilling to pay extra’. Contrast this directly 
with the CBAM tax that EU is willing to impose on products such as steel, for the so-called 
‘fair price on carbon emitted’ during production, imported from developing countries.  In the 
same survey, ~43% of respondents reported regular consumption of red meat and showed 
resistance to changing this lifestyle attribute with a large impact on climate change. The 
analysis further indicates that households’ general proclivity to the environment, does not 
influence their frequency of red meat consumption.
At this rate, the question seems less about sustainable choices, but more about a new play 
for capitalism. Having exhausted the extant industrial networks and saturation in product 
consumption, one can only create space for a whole new dynamic of industrial consumption 
- new industrial products, new markets, and new ways of taxing the ones still struggling to 
survive, so that the old status quo keeps thriving, and the ‘emerging’ are in a perpetual state 
of question.

in a significant resource constraint. And yet this country consistently delivers not only on

makes it want to become an efficient Market Economy, but not a Market Society. The difference 
between the two was first described by Karl Polanyi, who described the two37 as follows:
“This institutional gadget, which became the dominant force in the economy—now 
justly described as a market economy—then gave rise to yet another, even more extreme 
development, namely as a whole society embedded in the mechanism of its own economy—a 
market society.”
13.41.	 Simply put, a market economy - dominating the world economy today- is centred on 
the notion that supply and demand drive the production of goods and services, and prices are 
derived from the ‘invisible hand of free markets.’ A market society is often the culmination 
of a long-standing culture of market economics, whereby the social mores become heavily 
permeated by market values, leading to the commodification of areas that were traditionally 
governed by non-market norms.
13.42.	 India is not only not a market society but also at its root, a unique society where our 
culture, economy, societal norms, and environment are interlinked in a circuitous manner. 
As the forces foreign to us continue to shape our thought processes, India must be cautious in 
changing both lifestyle and user behaviour learning from societies different from ours, lest it 
impacts us in the future on 3Es - Equity, Environment, and Economics.
13.43.	 That market economics must not follow a universally-designed golden mean and must 
adapt to local conditions, is a point brought out well on several international platforms such as 
the 2005 and ensuing G20 declarations, the 2010-13 UN agreement that explicitly discarded 
One-Size-Fits-All (OSFA) and the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (Chart XIII.7).

Development and do what works in and for India
13.44.	 It’s time to acknowledge the market economy’s limitation in achieving emissions 
mitigation. Market discipline exists in theory as seen in numerous financial market busts. The 
market mechanism is pro-cyclical. Hence, it foments instability rather than being a force for 
stability. It seldom rewards a ‘good choice’ principally, but always the good choice financially.

The Meat Production Process and the destruction of the food-feed 
balance
13.45.	 Meat, due to its calorie density, has played a catalytic role38 in the evolution of humans 
and was an important source of nutrition until the development of agriculture approximately 
10,000 years ago. As societies settled and civilisations oriented around agriculture emerged 
in various parts of the world, the human race moved to a blend of plant- and animal-based 
cuisines over time. With time, improvements in agricultural research facilitated a significant 
expansion of the available plant-based food options, which are rich in nutrients and offer 
significant health benefits. Agricultural research has made it so that today, if one chooses to do 
so, it is completely possible for a human to meet all the nutritional requirements of their body 
from an exclusively plant-based diet and live a long, healthy life.
13.46.	 However, since the preference for meat is part of our evolutionary process and our 
digestive systems being clearly selected for an omnivorous diet, meat remains an important part 
of the nutritional mix. As societies moved towards affluence, the quantity of meat demanded 
also rose. North America and Europe saw their meat production grow by 2.5 times and 1.7 times, 
respectively, between 1961 and 200039. More important is the fact that increased production in 
these regions was facilitated by the emergence of the modern mass-scale feed industry, which 
now presents a credible and significant threat to food security around the globe.
13.47.	 The feed industry has emerged as such a massive undertaking that 33 per cent of the 
total arable land on the planet is now being utilised for feed crop production40, and new land 
being added through deforestation41  or repurposing existing farmlands42. Further, the reliance 
on human-edible crops under the Western method of meat production has set into motion 
a food-feed competition43 as more than one-third of the global cereal produced is utilised as 
animal feed. At the same time, one in ten humans still do not get enough to eat44.
13.48.	  A recent analysis published in ‘Nature’ highlighted that only 37 per cent of the harvested 
area of major crops is used for direct food consumption,45 while a large share of the human-
edible crops is now facing competing uses, primarily from the livestock industry. This is because 
1 kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of feed crop while 1 kilogram of lamb requires 15

livestock industry are maize (corn), soybean, legumes, bran and oilcake. These five crops are 
among the ten global crops that provide 83 per cent of all harvested food calories47.   
13.49.	 Furthermore, while croplands and crop yields have increased around the world, the 
proportion of crops being grown for food consumption has been declining since the 1960s (right 
around the time the feed industry began expanding in the West)48. For example, the United 
States, with its abundance of cropland, was once thought of as the “food basket”, but today, 
with the rampant appropriation of arable land for feed crops, it is more likely to be termed the 
“feed basket.”49.

13.50.	 Similar trends have begun emerging in other developing nations adopting the Western 
methods of animal husbandry, as rampant deforestation and shifting agricultural practices 
towards feed crop cultivation are presenting themselves as a major risk to food security in 
the developing world, especially with projected population growth trends. By 2030, many 
developing countries will not be able to fulfil the calories required for nourishment of the 
growing population due to the deficit in calories harvested as direct food crops50. Many non-
direct food crops not grown in wealthy countries are grown in developing countries for export 
to wealthy countries to supplement Western-style diets (such as feed for the meat industry)51. 
This is grim since land is already scarce, and arable land is even more so.

13.51.	 This shortage of land is now leading to a land squeeze around the world, as just feeding 
the growing population would require an additional 600 million hectares (nearly twice the size 
of India) by 205052. With more and more land being dedicated to growing animal feed rather 
than feeding each of the 828 million undernourished people affected by hunger53, is now not 
the time to arrest this trend? We should ponder for a minute to ask ourselves if this is really the 
best use of our scarce natural resources.
13.52.	 In addition to resource scarcity and food security threats looming over the horizon, the 
established methods of livestock cultivation are also highly unsustainable for the environment. 
Growing feed has been facilitated through industry standard practices such as monocropping, 
restricted crop rotation, incessant freshwater withdrawals54, excessive tillage, threatening local 
biodiversity55, and the application of synthetic pesticides and herbicides56. As one would expect, 
such practices are depleting farmland of its nutrients permanently, causing soil erosion and 
degrading the water quality57.
13.53.	 These practices cannot continue in the developed world. With the demand for meat 
expected to increase by 2050 due to rising incomes in the developing world, they definitely

cannot adopt the same practices established by the Western feed industries. These concerns had 
already been elucidated 22 years ago by Gerbens-Leenes & Nonhebel (2022)58. They stated, “In 
Western countries, the influence of food consumption patterns on related land requirement is 
substantial, resulting in large regional as well as inter-generational differences…On a global 
scale, it should be realized that a large part of the population is undernourished…If patterns 
in developing countries shift towards the affluent menus of western countries, related per 
capita land requirements will rise substantially.” India is already among the largest producers 
of meat in the world. Adopting the same practices followed elsewhere would result in disastrous 
consequences for the environment and the people at large.
13.54.	 Traditional farming practices from the developing world, where several agricultural 
activities are integrated with livestock rearing, offer one solution to the problem. Taking the 
example of India, our agricultural sector, primarily small and medium farm undertakings 
that engage in agriculture and livestock cultivation, has been practising sustainable farming 
for decades now (also called Integrated Farming System)59. By recycling farm waste and by-
products from other agricultural activities to serve as inputs for another activity (human inedible 
sources of feed such as grass and weeds plucked from fields, chaff and stubble collected post-
harvest, and other agro-waste), farming enterprises within India have been able to lower costs 
of production and enhance the productivity of their undertakings without upsetting the natural 
cycle. Similarly, the Integrated Farming Systems tested in African countries demonstrated that 
livestock-based integration not only helped the daily agricultural processes but also helped 
mitigate food security and malnutrition risks in humans as well as livestock60.
13.55.	 Shifting livestock to human-inedible feed can free up significant shares of global arable 
land to address global hunger. More food crops can be directed towards human consumption 
and alleviate food security risks worldwide. While such a strategy has obvious climate change 
mitigation benefits, one cannot ignore the adaptation benefits this strategy offers, too. 
Empowering farmers to reduce wastage and cultivate multiple income streams through an 
integrated farming system would help make a stressed sector within most developing countries 
a significant employment generator.
13.56.	 How meat is cultivated will heavily influence the risks associated with food security and 
our environment. While it is utopian to assume that the world would abandon meat consumption 
altogether and take up a completely vegan diet, in this hypothetical scenario, doing so would 
reduce the total land requirements for agriculture from 4.1 billion hectares to 1 billion hectares

(an area the size of North America, plus Brazil)61. The purpose of this hypothetical is not to 
agonise over whether to eat meat or not but to demonstrate that many more efficient ways are 
available to feed the planet.
13.57.	 Feeding an expected 10 billion people by 2050 is not trivial. Changes need to be brought 
about to the meat production processes without any delay, and the developing world should not 
only avoid emulating the environmentally and climatically unsustainable practices of the West 
but also point the way to the West, with its own food-feed balance practised for aeons.
13.58.	 To reiterate, a better food-feed balance will only need a fraction of the land that is 
currently used for food production. The entire world can still be well-fed and leave more land 
for other purposes, such as renewable power generation. Instead, what we face is the danger 
or prospect that Western practices of cattle-rearing will spread to the rest of the world, just 
as the Western obsession with Artificial Intelligence and feeding it with copious quantities 
of data for it to become truly intelligent is consuming vast amounts of energy and water and 
upending energy generation plans in many countries. Developing countries are falling line, lest 
they fall behind in a chimeric race for technological competitiveness, unmindful of social and 
environmental consequences. The parallel cannot be any more uncanny than this.
Housing
13.59.	 As countries move towards economic development, one of the changes they experience is 
in the social fabric of society which in today’s world, is a Western model of living, i.e., nucleated 
families and single-person residences. It is estimated62  today that nearly 50 per cent of all 
households63  in India are nuclear (1-4 members), up from 38 per cent in 2008. On average, a 
typical nuclear family in India had an average of 3 members vis-a-vis 7 in a joint family setup 
– nucleation rising in South India as opposed to North India. This is a major shift from our 
older societal norms of multi-generational living with Hindu undivided families (HUF) living 
under the same roof.  Chapter 8 of this survey on India’s labour markets notes that a report by 
the United Nations Population Fund and the International Institute for Population Sciences 
emphasises the importance of elderly people living in multi-generational households. Indians 
did not really have to learn this from a United Nations report. It was part of our tradition. 
Naturally nucleated living gives rise to demand for additional housing units, smaller and more 
independent in nature. Given that the demand is only expected to double by 205064 and the 
sheer complexity involved due to urban areas in size ranging from over 15 million to a few 
thousand people as well as local vs new settlements, and different housing-building practices, 
India has a looming housing issue on the horizon.

13.60.	 Land, on the other hand, remains constricted, but aspirations are not so. Many high-
income urban nucleated settlements give rise to the tendency of urban sprawl65, which is linked 
to higher energy consumption, elevated pollution levels, and increased traffic congestion causing 
significant negative environmental externalities66.  The correlation between household size and 
adverse impact on sustainability is being recognised all over the world. A 2021 research paper67 
says that the decrease in average household size in China over the past few decades is leading 
to a loss of scale economies. The paper further states, ‘‘CO2 emission, water withdrawal, 
smoke ash emission, SO2 emission, NOx emission, and industrial wastewater discharge were 
found to increase with a smaller household size. For example, a household size reduction of 
0.5 (to 2.5 members) by 2030–2035 could result in a 0.5% increase in CO2 emission and a 
0.3% increase in water withdrawal as compared with the levels in 2015. The increase in CO2 
emission is almost equal to the entire emissions of Portugal.”
13.61.	 Despite this, our living dwellings today mimic a universalised model of living – dominated 
by concrete, closed spaces, less ventilation, and a higher need for air conditioning, as opposed 
to multi-generational family homes in older times. Traditional Indian living spaces were built 
far more sustainably – a central courtyard that allowed for ventilation, natural lighting and 
cooling, and more co-habitation, usage of local building materials that prevented the need for 
transporting the high amount of concrete over long distances, building practices that did not 
require highly mechanised environments and had local labour filling in the gap. Unfortunately, 
much of this is not documented as ‘sustainable practice’.
13.62.	 The world knows sustainable housing as one that is characterised by solar and 
wind-powered energy, specially manufactured low-energy windows, and the use of LEDs. 
Unfortunately, keeping only these norms as a measure of sustainability is a false positive due 
to two reasons – 1) it requires reengineering of the entire building and construction ecosystem 
which is difficult in a resource-constrained environment 2) the impact of small measures is over-
calculated in place of the lifecycle cost of higher-density, non-nucleated living with traditional 
building homes.
13.63.	 With more and more changes in Indian lifestyles of living, the environmental impact of 
these activities of a large population is only going to exacerbate the climate change issue.

THE INDIAN WAY: A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE
“mātā bhūmih putruahan prthivyā:68’’ (Prithvi Sukta, Shlok 12)
13.64.	 Time and again, when a major adversity shakes the world out of its stupor, the relative 
resilience of Indians is a subject of great surprise69. The natural resilience emanates from this 
land’s deep, spiritual, and philosophical understanding of the concept of cycles of creation and 
destruction.
13.65.	 Nowhere, it is greatly reflected than in our relationship with ‘Nature’ that not only has 
tremendous power, but also a mind and temper of its own. We need to be in sync with its order 
because nature is not going to change its laws for the assumed strategies of man. Hence, global 
environmental and sustainability strategy must be in accordance with the cyclic temperament 
of Nature rather than in the misplaced belief that our industrial siloed actions can alter even a 
sliver of its fabric. It is here where India can help.
13.66.	 Even as the traditional scientific approaches to climate change are welcome, it’s high 
time that India adopted and disseminated its wisdom of pursuing a life of sustainability. 
While India agrees with the need for top-down policy-level changes, we also believe in the 
collective power of small individual actions. That each person contributes to both emission 
generation as well as emission reduction is a simple fact that we must take into account while 
designing policies, and awareness programmes, or even while tabulating statistics related to 
the environment.

MISSION LIFE (LIFESTYLE FOR ENVIRONMENT)
13.68.	 This thought process was at the base of Mission LiFE70, announced by Prime Minister 
Modi, at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCC COP2026) which seeks to bring 
individual responsibility to the forefront of the global climate narrative. It derives its philosophy 
from ancient Indian philosophy that espouses a naturally sustainable lifestyle in accordance 
with nature, steering individual actions and collective demand towards pro-planet choices.  
It encompasses a comprehensive but non-exhaustive list of 75 LiFE Actions for adoption by 
individuals to live more sustainably.
68  (Rigveda,1/90/6,7,8) invokes divine intervention to bliss and protect the environment. “madhu vātāh ritāyate

Chart XIII.10: LiFE Themes
13.69.	 Taking this philosophy forward, LiFE should have a doctrine for the world, resting on 5 
fundamental principles.
Individual action is the core of Climate Responsibility
13.70.	 As described in the previous sections, no economic or industrial strategy is going to be 
successful without the world’s population changing its approach to climate and environment. 
Hence, before compelling poorer nations to change their developmental journey, it’s necessary 
for individuals, especially in the developed world, to alter their lifestyle in favour of simple 
behavioural changes, all of which directly contribute to mitigation efforts.
13.71.	 India has great experience in individual-led sustainable behaviours - using a cloth for 
kitchen cleaning instead of tissue papers, leaves instead of disposable plates and packaging 
material, water-based toilet cleaning systems, reuse and upcycling of household items, and 
even ancient home remedies of pest control focussed on route deviation rather than killing. 
Practising a lifestyle where we indulge in less of ‘fast fashion’, getting things repaired than 
thrown at the first sight of discomfort, turning off lights when not using the room/area, etc, and 
digital consciousness in the form of accepting bills as e-bills rather than paper bills, conserving 
electricity through the purchase of energy-efficient products, switching off when not in use, 
adopting cleantech products, virtual meetings but physical activities like outdoor run, use 
of solar water heaters.  This is not even taught, and it’s imbibed, learned, and passed on to 
successive generations. Unfortunately, this is changing in favour of capitalistic practices derived 
from market societies, since they are, unfortunately, seen as symbols of upward migration.
13.72.	 At the core of it, it does seem duplicitous to talk about sustainability to poorer countries 
without changing anything about global lifestyle driven by overconsumption, beef-eating, and

fast fashion. Individuals must be encouraged to give up voluntarily these energy sins and bring 
their actions in line with their stated purpose. A change in demand will automatically cause a 
change in supply by relevant industries.
13.73.	 Voluntary relinquishment is not new in India. With a historical ashram-based71  culture 
where householders give up their material desires voluntarily to advance towards devotion to 
society and God, the principles have been used for greater community welfare even in present 
times. The ‘Give It Up’ LPG Subsidy Scheme is perhaps the best example of this theory in practice 
at scale.  #GiveItUp’ campaign launched in 2015, aimed at motivating 5.7 million Liquefied 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) users who could afford to pay the market price for LPG to voluntarily 
surrender their LPG subsidy to help pay for LPG cylinders to those rural women who depended 
on firewood for cooking food. Cooking on open fires and on inefficient wood-burning stoves 
emits close to 25% of global black carbon emissions. This brilliant individual renunciation for a 
higher cause not only reduced ill-health incidences in women but also directly impacted climate 
change.
13.74.	 Voluntary planting of trees and keeping surroundings clean and minimalistic contribute 
directly to environmental impact. Usage of locally sourced nature-based artisan choices like 
pattals, and bamboo bottles, refraining from excessive plastic use, and, making conscious choices 
in favour of sustainability will go a long way in curbing large-scale demand for environmentally 
adverse things.
13.75.	 One area where individual action is most desired and most needed is water reuse, less 
wastage, and water conservation. Water is not only the elixir of life but a non-negotiable as far 
as existence is concerned. The greatest news about Mars was the possibility of water on that 
planet72, such is its importance. So, even as governments step in to increase water supply, bring 
in efficiency, and redirect non-potable water to other uses, Individuals must drastically reduce 
their wastage of this extremely precious resource. Small actions such as collecting kitchen 
water to water plants, not leaving taps endlessly open, and using rainwater harvesting to utilise 
rainwater are both doable and desirous in the context of climate change.
Collective policy reflective of Individual pro-planet choices 
13.76.	 Consistency. Compounding. Two words when practised can make and break empires. 
Small but consistent actions have a large compounding effect observable across time. The 
Japanese even have a term for it – ‘Kaizen’. As described above, individual choices on a daily 
basis can help in sustainability, but even greater is a collective policy of pro-planet small 
everyday choices, but nudged and mandated by the government. These are reflected in several 
actions as follows:

Climate Change and India
471
(a)	 Using air-conditioning and thermostats at more optimum and sustainable 
temperatures73: As pointed out by the Prime Minister of India, there is little sense in 
keeping temperatures artificially low to 17-18 degrees and then using a blanket. Default 
settings on ACs and temperatures in public places like malls, offices, and airports can be 
increased from 18 to 24-25 degrees. Popularly called the ‘Air conditioning paradox’74, as 
this article75 beautifully describes, it is a Catch-22 situation “One of the great ironies of 
climate change is that as the planet warms, the technology that people need to stay cool 
will only make the climate hotter.”  With a large population cramped in small places, 
India cannot afford to go down the individual air-conditioning route, where every small 
room has an AC and makes the neighbouring air so worse off that they require another, 
thus setting off a vicious circle. Not earlier than 15 years ago also, most households in 
India did not have access to ACs and instead relied on a combination of approaches – khus 
cooling with intermittent use of water coolers and earthen pots for water. The capitalist 
approach to solving any problem requires manufacturing at scale, thereby ushering in 
modern air-conditioners, which seem to have made the problem worse. India must vote 
to bring in a mix of modern air-conditioners and our traditional mechanisms – ventilated 
construction, large windows, use of local materials, water-based cooling systems, and 
usage of fans wherever possible.
(b)	 Reducing the need to carry disposable plastic bags repeatedly on errands, 
both by decreasing consumption and replacing them with reusable fabric bags. More than 
1 million bags are used every minute with an average working life of 15 minutes, but stay 
on the earth’s surface forever, unless recycled.
(c)	 Building a culture of water reuse through individual behaviour change and 
mandated design specifications in favour of structures like rainwater harvesting. Water is 
becoming scarcer and scarcer resources. Some regions of the world have almost no access 
to fresh water. Governments should mandate water-efficient technologies and re-examine 
water-wasting ones (e.g., Reverse Osmosis water machines, single flush toilets).
(d)	 Practicing sustainable agriculture through the use of local seeds and natural 
farming practices. Agriculture residue to be used for mulching and composting.
(e)	 Fiscal Incentives for large households rather than single or two-person 
households, indirectly nudge societies to favour sustainable choices.
13.77.	 Increased demand will re-energise the market for sustainable, traditional products that 
were made by local skilled workers and did not require industries from across the world to 
produce. Moreover, products of ivory, leather, and those made of endangered species must be 
individually discouraged and policy-banned. Circularity and reuse of waste products must be 
incentivised by the government. A good example will be the Government’s mandate for ethanol 
blending in petrol, achieving the target of 10% in 2022.
73  Use of AC continuously can increase city temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius.

13.78.	 Another area where individual choices and government action must converge is Fashion 
and Textiles. As per UNEP, the fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and 
is responsible for 2-8% of global carbon emissions, 24% of insecticides, and 11% of pesticides. 
Apart from voluntary reuse and upcycling of clothes, there is a strong need for a Policy on 
Circularity in Textiles in India, as currently, less than 50% of textile waste in India undergoes 
any kind of reuse, repair, or remanufacture.
Incorporation of local and sustainable geography and culture 
13.79.	 ‘Annam Brahmam’ or Food is God. Ancient India wrote this in black and white and left 
it for successive generations to ponder upon. However, in the flurry of everything that is ‘not 
us’ being better, local food gave way to packaged fast-food and food choices different from the 
geography of our existence. Even today, Indian cuisine is primarily plant-based. This doesn’t 
mean that everyone is a vegetarian; it means that the bulk of our food base remains vegetarian 
– rice, dal, roti, and meat are an added separate delicacy. It is the same in our packaged food 
such as chips which are almost 99.99% plant-based, given the diverse food people eat across 
a country this large. Most of the cuisines are heavily dependent on local geography which not 
only provides a medicinal value to food but also reduces ecological footprint and reduces energy 
requirements. This is opposed to the global practice of industry-supplied veganism where in 

Climate Change and India
473
order to eat more sustainable food, one has to be dependent on avocados flying from halfway 
across the world or soy milk which has previously caused Amazon rainforest degradation76.
13.80.	 Good health is a great economic contributor also because all episodes of ill health 
cause double economic losses – reduction of productive time and costs spent on recovery. 
While modern medicine has done a great job of germ-based infection recovery and biological 
engineering, India has practised Ayurveda for years, which emphasises existence in accordance 
with nature, prevention rather than cure, and natural remedies rather than clinical supplements 
with an unclear understanding of their long-term damage. ‘Popping the pill’ culture must give 
way to a greater curiosity around the ‘why’ of ill health (which is not due to any accident / 
congenital issue/toxicity) and the role that our local food and medicinal systems will play in 
bringing down their incidences.
13.81.	 It’s time that the world adopted this Golden Principle of sustainable ingestion – eat 
local, eat fresh, eat sustainably:
-	
More plant-based diet.
-	
Use of leaf-based disposable plates instead of Styrofoam and single-use plastic.
-	
Use of fermented products (as is dominant in Asian cultures) that use natural sun storage 
for achieving the desired state.
-	
Upcycling food waste, or organic composting food waste (sour milk to paneer and reuse of 
whey water for lentils).
-	
Growing medicinal herbs such as Tulsi, and neem around us.
-	
Afforestation of water-table saving trees.
-	
Eating seasonally and locally – e.g. more millets than quinoa.
-	
Production of natural varieties and seed harvesting are to be publicly incentivised. 
Public Policy and not the Market at the helm of undertaking the ‘right’ 
decision
13.82.	 This approach focuses on influencing individual behaviours through policy approaches. 
How individuals behave and choose to consume is shaped by the surrounding norms, policies, 
incentives, and infrastructure, and herein there is a role for governments, community leaders, 
and media.
13.83.	 The Ujala program, launched in 2015, to encourage energy-efficient LED lights 
has resulted in energy savings of around 48 billion kWh per year and estimated savings of 
USD 2.5bn per year. People were incentivised to adopt these LED lights by bringing down buying 
costs for people. This was possible through govt. plans for bulk procurement and supply. By 
harnessing individual and collective awareness efforts, including even of children, the program 
brought about widespread change. Thus, a people-behaviour lifestyle change approach directly 
helped in climate mitigation.

13.84.	 According to the International Energy Agency’s modelling, the adoption of the kinds 
of actions and measures targeted by the LiFE initiative worldwide would reduce annual global 
CO2 emissions by more than 2 billion tonnes (Gt) in 2030 (20% of the emissions reductions 
needed by 2030) and in consumer savings of about USD 440 billion. That is non-trivial.
“… transformation on the supply side will not be enough; demand-side transformations will 
also be essential to stay within planetary boundaries. Energy requirements for providing 
decent living standards to the global population can be drastically reduced, but in addition 
to the use of the most efficient available technologies, this implies a radical transformation 
of consumption patterns, including political procedures to prioritise between competing 
consumption claims.” 77
13.85.	 The importance of public investment in undertaking transformational projects cannot 
be emphasised enough. Our world’s history is replete with such examples - post-WW II 
reconstruction, exploration of space, the development of the internet (during its prototype 
stages), and the Highways construction project in the USA in the Sixties – were handled and 
executed by the public sector, based on government funding or funding by public authorities – 
domestic, international or multilateral. Similarly, today, there is a need for public investment 
in carbon sequestration, carbon sinks, battery storage technologies, and green hydrogen will 
obviate problems with intellectual property rights and help assert the global public nature of 
solutions.
13.86.	 However, this must be accommodated by awareness campaigns towards Mission LiFE 
in all relevant areas, starting early from school onwards, as was done for behaviour change 
towards Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign in Swachh Bharat.
Mindful consumption of resources, based on need and not greed
13.87.	 It is unfortunate that the predominant measure of a country’s worth comes from an 
ever-increasing GDP, which is driven primarily by consumption in a capitalist world. Derek 
Brower, Amanda Chu, and Myles McCormick say in FT78, that “Capitalism won’t deliver the 
energy transition fast enough. For all the cleantech advances and renewable deployment in 
recent decades, fossil fuels’ share of total global energy use was 86% in 2000 and 82% in 
2023.”
13.88.	 Countries must therefore look at encouraging sustainable lifestyles – emphasis on 
low wastages on adjusting life in a way that ‘wants’ don’t become ‘needs’. That’s living well 
but harmoniously. Excesses of materialism only have negative externalities - more wastage, 
more littering, more eternal garbage sitting on the earth’s surface, less happiness – the law of 
diminishing marginal utility of the happiness-ownership curve can be seen in everyday lives. 
Most of the generation that is between ages 30 and 70 has seen a life where disposability and

dispensability were not a part of existence. Materiality was linked to long periods of sacrifice 
and the rare acquisition that fuelled feelings of happiness. 
13.89.	 It's a philosophical shift from the way we understand life. A large body of research79 
has brought forward the theory of the ‘Paradox of Choice’ that runs counterintuitive to the 
ideas of Capitalism.  Even though choice is good for us, its relationship to contentment is quite 
complicated, and choice overload80  leads to a large set of negative outcomes. These range from 
indecisiveness to confusion to complications to dissatisfaction. In the Picture of Dorian Gray, 
Oscar Wilde says “Nowadays, people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”
13.90.	 The final principle of LiFE implores us to enjoy the intrinsic value of things and 
experiences, without overburdening ourselves with overconsumption. It is not about living 
ascetically but living mindfully. When leaving half a bottle of water, and picking up another, 
it’s time to remember that this plastic will not only outlive us, but also our children and our 
grandchildren, and that is probably not the future we wish to bequeath them.
CONCLUSION
13.91.	 The most important human factor in enlivening these principles to life is also one of 
the most elusive in modern life – Thahraav (Bgjko) or Settlement/Contentment that comes 
with Equanimity.  It is not stoppage, it is not stagnation, and it is not even a compromise. 
It is a human’s ability to have the confidence and the power to opt for internal stability to 
prepare for and accept outside change. It is only when humans can channel this energy that 
they can stop asking for more. It is the absence of such contentment that has made erstwhile 
communal things in the home become individual – e.g., television.  Things unavailable didn’t 
cause grown men to cry and children to shrink from playing with others. This stands in contrast 
with the consumption-oriented living of today, where every individual is a consumer (especially 
children81), instead of a family. That’s why households, today, need more devices per person 
as compared to a single television earlier. Within that one statement lies the entire linkage 
between social mores, overconsumption, disposability, and growing mountains of trash. As per 
IFC, ‘world generates over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually82, and is expected 
to increase 70% by 2050.’
13.92.	 The hunger to consume more and more means we keep missing the bus in the global 
discourse on sustainability, by constantly suggesting rewiring the pathways to renewables 
rather than attacking the root of the problem. Treating the symptoms to cure a growing disease.

13.93.	 It’s time to rebuild societies with equanimity.
13.94.	 Internal equanimity contributes to more acceptance of others and, therefore to better 
human relations, which we now know, is also more conducive to larger, cohesive families, 
and consequently better social and sustainable impact. Access to more material choices and 
economic betterment shouldn’t throw us so off-balance that we forget we come from Nature 
and must return to it. Our conscious and unconscious choices should not be divorced from the 
drivers of life on earth. Hence, the global movement on climate change must be accommodative 
of sovereign choices and economic needs, but centred on individual behaviour - ‘LiFE’.
